Only 790 consumers, who purchased the bean bag chairs, have responded to the recall. CPSC and Ace Bayou are urging consumers to install the free repair kit to permanently disable the bean bag chairsâ€™ zippers so that they cannot be opened. \r\n \r\nCPSC is extremely concerned that these recalled bean bag chairs are continuing to be used by children. The foam beads inside the chairs are serious suffocation and choking hazards for children. Two children died after suffocating on the chairâ€™s foam beads. An additional incident has been reported to CPSC involving a 6 year old boy who opened bean bag and reportedly swallowed some foam beads and had others in his nose and mouth.\r\n \r\nThe recalled bean bag chairs have two zippers, including an outer zipper that does not have a pull tab and another zipper directly underneath that zipper. Although the outer zipper on the bean bag chair does not have a pull tab, children can open it. Once they have opened the outer zipper, they can open the inner zipper which contains the foam beads and crawl inside. Children can suffocate or choke on these foam beads. The voluntary standard requires non-refillable bean bag chairs to have closed and permanently disabled zippers. Ace met the voluntary standardâ€™s requirement for a warning label.\r\n \r\nThe two deaths involved a 13-year old boy from McKinney, Texas died and a 3-year-old girl from Lexington, Ky. who suffocated from lack of air and inhaling the chairâ€™s foam beads. Both children were found inside the chairs. \r\n \r\nThe recalled chairs with zippers that can be opened were sold in a variety of sizes, shapes, colors and fabrics. They include round or L-shaped, vinyl or fabric, and are filled with polystyrene foam beads. They were sold in a variety of colors, including purple, violet, blue, red, pink, yellow, Kelly green, black, port, navy, lime, royal blue, turquoise, tangerine and multi-color. The round bean bag chairs were sold in three sizes, 30, 32 and 40 inches in diameter. The L-shaped bean bag chair measures 18 inches wide by 30 inches deep by 30 inches high. â€œACE BAYOU CORPâ€? is printed on a tag sewn into the bean bag chairâ€™s cover seam. They were made in China.\r\n \r\nThe recalled bean bag chairs were sold at Bergner's, Big Lots, Bon-Ton, Boston Store, Carson's, Elder-Beerman, Herberger's, Meijer, Pamida, School Specialty, Wayfair, Walmart and Younkers stores and online at Amazon.com, Meijer.com, Walmart.com and other websites from 1995 to 2013 for between $30 and $100.\r\n \r\nTo prevent another death, consumers should check the outside zipper on their bean bag chair to ensure that it has a metal staple to disable the outer zipper. If it does not have a metal staple, take the recalled bean bag chair away from children immediately and contact Ace Bayou for the free repair kit to permanently disable the zipper. \r\n \r\nAce Bayou bean bag chair b-roll available at:\r\nhttps://www.hightail.com/download/ZWJWcHBGUnJveE5vZE1UQw",

The caddyâ€™s latches do not automatically close to secure the stages and risers when stored. Unsecured stages and risers can fall off the caddies and onto consumers. A 3-year-old girl died in May 2011 in Greenville, S.C., from severe head trauma when a portion of a portable stage fell out of the caddy and onto her at a church. This recall involves Midwest Folding Productsâ€™ caddies used to store collapsible stages and risers when they are not being used. The caddies are brown, gray or black metal and measure 44 inches long by 30 inches wide by 60 inches high. They hold six 96-inch long or eight 48 to 72-inch long stage or riser platforms. Yellow caution and instruction labels are located on the caddyâ€™s frame. The recalled caddies were sold by Midwest Folding Productsâ€™ dealers to churches, schools, performing arts centers and various other organizations nationwide and online at www.midwestfolding.com from January 1989 through March 2012 for about $1,200. Midwest Folding Products is directly contacting known purchasers of the caddies. Caddy owners and consumers should immediately stop using the recalled stage and riser caddies. Caddy owners should contact Midwest Folding Products to receive a free repair kit with new brackets that will allow latches to automatically return to the closed position on the caddies and new white warning and instruction labels. For more information, contact Midwest Folding Products at (800) 621-4716 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. CT, or visit the firmâ€™s website at www.midwestfolding.com.

Clips that attach the tent to the top of the playard can break or be removed by a child. A child can lift the tent and become entrapped at the neck between the rigid playard frame and the metal base rod of the tent, posing a strangulation hazard. CPSC is aware of a death of a 2-year-old boy in December 2008 in Vinalhaven, Maine. The boy was found hanging with his neck entrapped between the playard frame and the metal base rod of the tent that had been partially tied by pieces of nylon rope and partially attached by clips. The tent was tied to the playard because the child was able to pop off the clips. Apparently, the child became entrapped while attempting to climb out of the playard. In three other incidents, children were able to remove one or more clips and place their necks between the tent and the playard. The children were not injured. The dome-shaped white-colored mesh tent is designed to fit over playards as small as 28 inches by 40 inches or as large as 31 inches by 44 inches to contain a child. There are 12 plastic clips to secure the base of the tent to the top rail of the playard through button holes along the bottom of the tent. The tent has a zippered side for putting in and taking out the child. This product was made in China and sold at Walmart, Amazon.com and various baby and childrenâ€™s stores nationwide from January 2005 through February 2010 for about $60. Consumers should immediately stop using the playard tents and contact Tots in Mind to get free replacement clips. Replacement clips will be available in late August or early September 2010. Contact Tots in Mind toll-free at (800) 626-0339 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday or visit the firmâ€™s website at -->www.TotsinMind.com Note: Health Canada's press release is available at http://cpsr-rspc.hc-sc.gc.ca/PR-RP/recall-retrait-eng.jsp?re_id=110",

        "Description": "March 1, 1994 Release # 94-039 PRODUCT: Approximately 23,400 distinctive C-shaped tubular metal frame children's bunk beds distributed to stores nationwide by the L. Powell Company, Inc. from June 1992 through March 31, 1993. The beds are models 440 (red), 446 (white), 447 (blue), and 448 (black). They use a twin-size mattress on the top and a full-size mattress on the bottom. They have C-shaped headboard and footboard frames, partial guard rails on both sides of the upper bunk, and a middle leg on the side rail of the bottom bunk. Powell's other beds are not affected. PROBLEM: These \"C\" beds may unexpectedly collapse. Bed occupants could be injured by the falling upper bunk. CPSC is investigating the collapse of similar beds imported by others. WHAT TO DO: Stop using the bed or place both bunks on the floor immediately; inspect all eight mattress support corners; then call Powell at (310) 204-2224, weekdays between 11:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Eastern time for a free corner kit designed to reinforce the bed and prevent collapse. WASHINGTON, DC -- The L. Powell Company Inc., Culver City, CA, in cooperation with CPSC, is voluntarily providing a free corner kit to reinforce certain distinctive C-shaped children's tubular metal bunk beds imported and distributed by the company. According to Powell, the upper bunk on these beds could fall suddenly --usually after squeaking or creaking that consumers may not recognize as warning sounds -- causing the bunk bed to collapse. Powell's action responds to a CPSC bunk bed industry safety alert. The Powell Company has received 36 reports of \"C\" beds collapsing, including five reports of injury. Powell imported and distributed about 23,400 \"C\" beds to stores from June 1992 through March 31, 1993. A large percentage of the beds were sold by Pace Membership Warehouse, Inc. and Costco Wholesale. Powell is one of the largest distributors of children's tubular metal bunk beds. This action is being taken due to the firm's strong commitment to consumer safety. No other Powell beds are affected by this repair program. The bunk beds subject to this program -- models 440 (red), 446 (white), 447 (blue), and 448 (black) -- have metal frames made of hollow, glossy painted tubes, with a twin-size mattress on the top bunk and a larger, full-size mattress on the bottom bunk. In addition, the beds have the following identifying features: - the head and foot end frames are designed in a distinctive C shape; - a middle leg is attached to the center of the side rail of the bottom bunk; - there is a partial guard rail on each side of the upper bunk; - a gold \"Warning\" label is located on the top of the C-shaped end frame at the head or foot of the bed;the letters \"FR\" followed by a date code (month and year) are located on one of the two bed end frames or bunk side rails (only beds with date codes before April 1993 (4 93) are included in this program); and - Powell's address, \"P.O. Box 1408, Culver City, CA 90232-1408,\" and the bed model number appear in the instructions and on the packaging. Any consumer who has one of these beds should immediately stop using it as a bunk bed. The bed can be used temporarily if both bunks are placed on the floor. The consumer should inspect all eight mattress support corners for breaks or cracks in the metal or paint around the welds and then call Powell at (310) 204-2224, weekdays between 11:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Eastern time. Any consumer who has a \"C\" bed made before April 1993 will receive a corner kit free of charge. The kit is designed to reinforce the bed and prevent collapse and has been tested by CPSC. CPSC is investigating numerous other importers and manufacturers of metal bunk beds that may present a similar risk of collapsing. To date, bed suppliers industry-wide have received more than 400 complaints of collapsing bunk beds. CPSC urges consumers to inspect all eight mattress support corners of all metal bunk beds for breaks or cracks in the paint or metal around the welds. Consumers should stop using damaged bunk beds and contact the retailer, manufacturer, or importer. To assist CPSC in its continuing industry-wide bunk bed investigation, consumers are urged to call the CPSC toll-free hotline weekdays at 1-800-638-2772 to report incidents or injuries involving metal bunk beds.

This hazard may be present even though the lamp switch is in the \"off\" position. Brass floor lamp models 2607, 2618 and 2620 sold nationwide since January 1987 are being recalled. They sold for about $50 each. All lamps feature three metal support legs bolted to a metal central post by metal screws or bolts. - Model 2607 features a single light socket atop the center post and three planter supports at the ends of the U- shaped support legs. - Model 2618 features a triple light socket and planter supports at the ends of the support legs. - Model 2620 features a glass tea table which rests atop three C-shaped metal support legs bolted to the central post. The company said certain screws holding the legs to the lamp's center post may be too long and could pierce the power cord insulation, energizing the entire brass frame. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has learned that one child was electrocuted in Alaska. Consumers with any of the lamps should immediately unplug them from electrical outlets and return the product to the store where purchased for a full refund of the purchase price. Consumers may also call Coaster Company of America at 1-800-221-9699 for additional information about the recall; California residents should call 213-944-7899",

        "Description": "Bicycle Child Carriers Recalled by Hamill & Hufman NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 15, 1976 Release # 76-070 CPSC, Hamill Manufacturing Co., And Huffman Manufacturing Co., Announce Recall Of Bicycle Child Carriers WASHINGTON, D.C. (Oct. 15) -- Hamill Manufacturing Company, Washington, Michigan, and the Huffman Manufacturing Company, Dayton, Ohio, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, today warned consumers that 25,000 bicycle child carriers may separate from the bicycle if not carefully installed. The carriers were sold nationally under the trade name \"Tote Along\" during the summer of 1976. Persons who have these carriers should carefully inspect both the latching mechanism which locks the detachable child seat to the carrier and the metal clamp which attaches the front of the carrier to the bicycle frame. Before placing a child in the carrier, check to see that the seat and clamp are secure. The warning was issued after the companies reported to CPSC 10 accidents which involved either a separation of the seat from the carrier or of the carrier from the bicycle. Separation of the seat from the carrier appears to have been caused by a failure to push the seat onto the carrier far enough to secure the locking mechanism. Separation of the carrier from the bicycle may have been caused by consumer misalignment of the metal clamp components and/or extreme over-tightening of the bolt passing through the clamp. In the interest of child safety, the companies are recalling the \"Tote Along\" carrier and are offering a refund to consumers who send them the seat clamp. For instructions on how to receive a refund, consumers should write The Hamill Manufacturing Company, Consumer Relations Department, P.O. Box 255, Washington, Michigan 48094, or call Hamill collect at the following number: 216/379-7792.",
