        <Description>WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), in cooperation with IKEA North America, of Conshohocken, Pa., is announcing the recall of all chests and dressers that do not comply with the performance requirements of the U.S. voluntary industry standard (ASTM F2057-14). The recalled childrenâ€™s chests and dressers are taller than 23.5 inches and adult chests and dressers are taller than 29.5 inches. The 29 million units of recalled chests and dressers include: MALM 3-drawer, 4-drawer, 5-drawer and three 6-drawer models and other childrenâ€™s and adult chests and dressers. The recalled chests and dressers are unstable if they are not properly anchored to the wall, posing a serious tip-over and entrapment hazard that can result in death or serious injuries to children.
 
            On July 22, 2015, CPSC and IKEA announced a repair program for the chests and dressers that included a free wall-anchoring repair kit for the MALM chests and dressers and other IKEA chests and dressers. Two tragic fatalities involving MALM chests and dressers occurred prior to the announcement of the repair program:
 
            â—� In February 2014, a 2-year-old boy from West Chester, Pa. died after a 6-drawer
            MALM chest tipped over and fatally pinned him against his bed.
            â—� In June 2014, a 23-month-old boy from Snohomish, Wash. died after he became
            trapped beneath a 3-drawer MALM chest that tipped over. 
 
            Subsequent to the July 2015 announcement, CPSC and IKEA learned of additional tip-over incidents, including a February 2016 incident in which a 22-month-old boy from Apple Valley, Minn. died when a MALM 6-drawer chest fell on top of him. 
 
            None of the chests or dressers in the above-listed incidents had been anchored to the wall. In addition to the three deaths, IKEA received reports of 41 tip-over incidents involving the MALM chests and dressers, resulting in 17 injuries to children between the ages of 19 months and 10 years old.
 
            The MALM chests and dressers are constructed of particleboard or fiberboard and are white, birch (veneer), medium brown, black-brown, white stained oak (veneer), oak (veneer), pink, turquoise, grey, grey-turquoise, lilac, green, brown stained ash (veneer), and black. A 5-digit supplier number, 4-digit date stamp, IKEA logo, country of origin and â€œMALMâ€� are printed on the underside of the top panel or inside the side panel. 
 
            Since 1996, IKEA chests and dressers have been labeled to identify IKEA, the model name and the manufacturing date.
 
            The recalled MALM chests were sold from 2002 through June 2016 for between $70 and $200.

            IKEA also received 41 reports of tip-overs involving chests and dressers other than MALMs, resulting in the deaths of three children and 19 injuries to children:
 

            In July 1989, a 20-month-old girl from Mt. Vernon, Va. died after an unanchored GUTE 4-drawer chest tipped over and pinned her against the footboard of a youth bed.
            In March 2002, a 2Â½-year-old boy from Cranford, N.J. died after an unanchored RAKKE 5-drawer chest tipped over and fatally pinned him to the floor.
            In October 2007, a 3-year-old girl from Chula Vista, Calif. died after a KURS 3-drawer chest tipped over and fatally pinned her to the floor. It is unknown as to whether the dresser was anchored or not.

 
            OTHER RECALLED CHESTS AND DRESSERS
 
            Most of the non-MALM chests and dressers included in this recall are listed on the IKEA website at www.IKEA-USA.com/recallchestsanddressers.
 
            Since 1996, IKEA chests and dressers have been labeled to identify IKEA, the model name and the manufacturing date.
 
            CPSC and IKEA are urging consumers to inspect their recalled IKEA chests and dressers to ensure that they are properly anchored to the wall. Chests and dressers should be properly anchored to the wall whether or not they meet the ASTM standard. Consumers should move any unanchored chests and dressers into storage or other areas where they cannot be accessed by children until the chests and dressers are properly anchored to the wall or removed from the home.
            To receive a refund or free wall-anchoring kit for IKEA chests and dressers listed above, visit an IKEA retail store, go to www.IKEA-USA.com/recallchestsanddressers, or call 866-856-4532 anytime.
            A child dies every two weeks and a child is injured every 24 minutes in the U.S. from furniture or TVs tipping over, according to CPSC data.</Description>

        <Description>WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Ace Bayou Corp., of New Orleans, La., are reannouncing the voluntary recall of about 2.2 million bean bag chairs sold from 1995 to 2013. Only 790 consumers, who purchased the bean bag chairs, have responded to the recall. CPSC and Ace Bayou are urging consumers to install the free repair kit to permanently disable the bean bag chairsâ€™ zippers so that they cannot be opened. 
 
            CPSC is extremely concerned that these recalled bean bag chairs are continuing to be used by children. The foam beads inside the chairs are serious suffocation and choking hazards for children. Two children died after suffocating on the chairâ€™s foam beads. An additional incident has been reported to CPSC involving a 6 year old boy who opened bean bag and reportedly swallowed some foam beads and had others in his nose and mouth.
 
            The recalled bean bag chairs have two zippers, including an outer zipper that does not have a pull tab and another zipper directly underneath that zipper. Although the outer zipper on the bean bag chair does not have a pull tab, children can open it. Once they have opened the outer zipper, they can open the inner zipper which contains the foam beads and crawl inside. Children can suffocate or choke on these foam beads. The voluntary standard requires non-refillable bean bag chairs to have closed and permanently disabled zippers. Ace met the voluntary standardâ€™s requirement for a warning label.
 
            The two deaths involved a 13-year old boy from McKinney, Texas died and a 3-year-old girl from Lexington, Ky. who suffocated from lack of air and inhaling the chairâ€™s foam beads. Both children were found inside the chairs. 
 
            The recalled chairs with zippers that can be opened were sold in a variety of sizes, shapes, colors and fabrics. They include round or L-shaped, vinyl or fabric, and are filled with polystyrene foam beads. They were sold in a variety of colors, including purple, violet, blue, red, pink, yellow, Kelly green, black, port, navy, lime, royal blue, turquoise, tangerine and multi-color. The round bean bag chairs were sold in three sizes, 30, 32 and 40 inches in diameter. The L-shaped bean bag chair measures 18 inches wide by 30 inches deep by 30 inches high. â€œACE BAYOU CORPâ€� is printed on a tag sewn into the bean bag chairâ€™s cover seam. They were made in China.
 
            The recalled bean bag chairs were sold at Bergner's, Big Lots, Bon-Ton, Boston Store, Carson's, Elder-Beerman, Herberger's, Meijer, Pamida, School Specialty, Wayfair, Walmart and Younkers stores and online at Amazon.com, Meijer.com, Walmart.com and other websites from 1995 to 2013 for between $30 and $100.
 
            To prevent another death, consumers should check the outside zipper on their bean bag chair to ensure that it has a metal staple to disable the outer zipper. If it does not have a metal staple, take the recalled bean bag chair away from children immediately and contact Ace Bayou for the free repair kit to permanently disable the zipper.

        <Description>This recall involves seven models of Burley Design child bicycle trailers manufactured from 2009 to 2015. The trailers allow cyclists to tow children behind their bicycles while riding. The trailers are connected to the bicycle by a tow bar, which attaches to the rear axle of the bicycle on one end and to a tow bar receiver on the trailer at the other end. The tow bar receiver is on the front left side of the trailer as it faces the rear wheel of the bicycle. Recalled trailers have a black plastic tow bar receiver with an integrated wheel guard. Recalled trailers can be identified by the first four characters of the serial numbers on the trailer. The serial number is on a sticker in the rear cargo area behind the seat of the trailer on the left inside frame bar. The following seven trailer models and serial numbers are being recalled:

        <Hazards>
            <Hazard>
                <Name>The sweaters have a drawstring around the neck area that poses a strangulation hazard to children. Drawstrings can become entangled or caught on playground slides, hand rails, school bus doors or other moving objects, posing a significant strangulation and/or entanglement hazard to children. In February 1996, CPSC issued guidelines about drawstrings in children's upper outerwear. In 1997, those guidelines were incorporated into a voluntary standard. Then, in July 2011, based on the guidelines and voluntary standard, CPSC issued a federal regulation. CPSC's actions demonstrate a commitment to help prevent children from strangling or getting entangled on neck and waist drawstrings in upper outerwear, such as jackets and sweatshirts.</Name>

        <Hazards>
            <Hazard>
                <Name>Drawstrings can become entangled or caught on playground slides, hand rails, school bus doors or other moving objects, posing a significant strangulation and/or entanglement hazard to children. In February 1996, CPSC issued guidelines about drawstrings in children's upper outerwear. In 1997, those guidelines were incorporated into a voluntary standard. Then, in July 2011, based on the guidelines and voluntary standard, CPSC issued a federal regulation. CPSC's actions demonstrate a commitment to help prevent children from strangling or getting entangled on neck and waist drawstrings in upper outerwear, such as jackets and sweatshirts.</Name>

        <Description>WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), in cooperation with IKEA North America, of Conshohocken, Pa., is announcing the recall for repair of childrenâ€™s wall-mounted lamps due to a strangulation hazard. A 16-month-old child in a crib died after getting entangled in the lampâ€™s cord. In a separate incident, a 15-month-old child in a crib became entangled in the lampâ€™s cord and nearly strangled. In both incidents, which occurred in Europe, the lamp cord was pulled into the crib by the infants. There were 2.9 million of the recalled lamps sold in the United States. In addition, 1.1 million were sold in Canada. There was a total of 23 million sold worldwide. The recalled IKEA childrenâ€™s SMILA-series wall-mounted lamps were sold in eight designs, including a blue star, yellow moon, pink flower, white flower, red heart, green bug, blue seashell and an orange seahorse. The blue star is the STJÃ„RNA model with article numbers 501.944.49 or 500.108.79. The yellow moon is the MÃ…NE model with article numbers 701.944.48 or 700.108.40. The pink flower is the BLOMMA model with article numbers 901.944.47 or 000.979.50. The white flower is the BLOMMA model with article number 300-746-50. The red heart is the HJÃ„RTA model with article numbers 202.256.59 or 801.993.13. The green bug is the BAGGE model with article numbers 101.944.46 or 700.728.71. The blue seashell is the SNÃ„CKA model with article number 400-982-50. The orange seahorse is the SJÃ–HÃ„ST model with article number 900-982-43. The model name is printed on a label on the inside back of the lamp near the light bulb. The article number is printed on the lampâ€™s packaging. The plastic wall-mounted childrenâ€™s lamps measure about 11 inches high by 11 inches wide. They have a 7 ft. long electrical cord with an in-line switch and take a 25-watt light bulb. They were sold exclusively at IKEA stores nationwide, in IKEAâ€™s catalog and online at ikea-usa.com from July 1999 through May 2013 for between $10 and $13. Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled lamp and contact IKEA for a free repair kit. Do not use the lamp until the repair kit is installed. The repair kit has self-adhesive fasteners for attaching the lampâ€™s cord to the wall as well as safety instructions. Contact IKEA toll-free at (888) 966-4532 anytime or online at www.ikea-usa.com and click on the Recall link at the top of the page for more information. The lamps were made in the United States, Lithuania and China.</Description>

            <Hazard>
                <Name>The hoodies and jackets have drawstrings through the hood or neck which pose a strangulation hazard to young children. In February 1996, CPSC issued guidelines about drawstrings in children's upper outerwear. In 1997, those guidelines were incorporated into a voluntary standard. Then, in July 2011, based on the guidelines and voluntary standard, CPSC issued a federal regulation. CPSC's actions demonstrate a commitment to help prevent children from strangling or getting entangled on neck and waist drawstrings in upper outerwear, such as jackets and sweatshirts.</Name>

                <Name>There have been 22 reports of incidents involving the recalled beds in the U.S. since 2009 and one in Canada. Two injuries were reported. In a 2009 incident in Madison, Wisconsin, an 11-year-old girl was placing a fitted sheet on the top bunk when the child, mattress and bed supports collapsed on her 6-year-old sister in the bed below. The 6 year old was treated at a hospital emergency department for a head injury involving a cut to her face.</Name>

Blind Xpress custom vertical blinds have an adjustment cord that forms a loop that is not attached to the wall or floor. In some instances, this loop has a weighted device at the bottom. The custom horizontal blinds do not have inner cord stop devices to prevent the accessible inner cords from being pulled out. A child can become entangled in a cord loop and strangle. This recall involves all Blind Xpress custom-made vertical blinds that do not have a cord-tensioning device that attaches to the wall or floor, as well as all horizontal blinds that do not have inner cord stop devices. The blinds were sold at various blind specialty stores in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana from January 1995 through December 2011 for between $16 and $380. These blinds were manufactured in the United States. CPSC urges consumers to immediately stop using the window coverings and contact the Window Covering Safety Council (WCSC) to receive a free repair kit. For more information, contact the WCSC toll-free at (800) 506-4636 anytime or visit www.windowcoverings.org 297c6a41b6a21b.jpg" alt="Foto del lazo que forma el cordÃ³n de una persiana vertical" width="721" height="576" /&gt; English versio</Description>

        <Description>August 1, 2012Release #12-239 Firm's Recall Hotline: (800) 621-4716 WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), in cooperation with Midwest Folding Products, of Chicago, Ill., is announcing a voluntary recall of about 5,300 stage and riser caddies due to risk of injury and death to consumers. The caddyâ€™s latches do not automatically close to secure the stages and risers when stored. Unsecured stages and risers can fall off the caddies and onto consumers. A 3-year-old girl died in May 2011 in Greenville, S.C., from severe head trauma when a portion of a portable stage fell out of the caddy and onto her at a church. This recall involves Midwest Folding Productsâ€™ caddies used to store collapsible stages and risers when they are not being used. The caddies are brown, gray or black metal and measure 44 inches long by 30 inches wide by 60 inches high. They hold six 96-inch long or eight 48 to 72-inch long stage or riser platforms. Yellow caution and instruction labels are located on the caddyâ€™s frame. The recalled caddies were sold by Midwest Folding Productsâ€™ dealers to churches, schools, performing arts centers and various other organizations nationwide and online at www.midwestfolding.com from January 1989 through March 2012 for about $1,200. Midwest Folding Products is directly contacting known purchasers of the caddies. Caddy owners and consumers should immediately stop using the recalled stage and riser caddies. Caddy owners should contact Midwest Folding Products to receive a free repair kit with new brackets that will allow latches to automatically return to the closed position on the caddies and new white warning and instruction labels. For more information, contact Midwest Folding Products at (800) 621-4716 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. CT, or visit the firmâ€™s website at www.midwestfolding.com.

        <Description>July 24, 2012Release #12-232 Firm's Recall Hotline: (888) 734-6020 WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), in cooperation with Peg Perego USA Inc., of Fort Wayne, Ind., is announcing a voluntary recall of about 223,000 strollers due to a risk of entrapment and strangulation. A 6-month-old baby boy from Tarzana, Calif. died of strangulation after his head was trapped between the seat and the tray of his Peg Perego stroller in 2004. Another baby, a 7-month-old girl from New York, N.Y., nearly strangled when her head became trapped between the seat and the tray of her stroller in 2006. Entrapment and strangulation can occur, especially to infants younger than 12 months of age, when a child is not harnessed. An infant can pass through the opening between the stroller tray and seat bottom, but his/her head and neck can become entrapped by the tray. Infants who become entrapped at the neck are at risk of strangulation. The recall involves two different older versions of the Peg Perego strollers, Venezia and Pliko-P3, manufactured between January 2004 and September 2007, in a variety of colors. They were manufactured prior to the existence of the January 2008 voluntary industry standard which addresses the height of the opening between the stroller's tray and the seat bottom. The voluntary standard requires larger stroller openings that prevent infant entrapment and strangulation hazards. Only strollers that have a child tray with one cup holder are part of this recall. Strollers with a bumper bar in front of the child or a tray with two cup holders are not included in this recall. The following Venezia and Pliko-P3 stroller model numbers that begin with the following numbers are included in this recall. The model number is printed on a white label on the back of the Pliko P-3's stroller seat and on the Venezia stroller's footboard. Pliko-P3 StrollerModel NumbersVenezia StrollerModel Numbers IPFR28US34xxxxxxxx IPPF28NA32 IPVA13MU09 IPFT28NA63 IPPF28NA57 IPVA13MU10 IPFT28NA64 IPPF28NA65 IPVA13US09 IPP328MU10 IPPF28NA66 IPVA13US10 IPP328MU09 IPPF28NA67 IPVA13US32 IPP328US09 IPPF28NA68 IPVA13US34 IPP328US10 IPPO28US32 IPVC13NA32 IPP329US10 IPPO28US34 IPVC13NA34 IPPA28US32 IPPO28US62 IPPA28US33 IPPO28US69 IPPA28US34 IPPO28US70 IPPD28NA34 IPPO28US71 "Peg Perego" and "Venezia" or "Pliko-P3" are printed on the side of the strollers. The strollers were sold at various retailers nationwide, including Babies R Us and Buy Buy Baby from January 2004 through September 2010 for between $270 and $330 for the Pliko P-3 stroller and between $350 and $450 for the Venezia stroller. They were manufactured in Italy. Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled strollers and contact the firm for a free repair kit. Do not return the stroller to the retailers as they will not be able to provide the repair kit. For additional information, call Peg Perego at (888) 734-6020 anytime or visit the firm's website at www.PegPeregoUSA.com CPSC and Peg Perego warn consumers that these strollers may be available on the secondhand market, in thrift stores or at yard sales. Consumers should not buy or sell these recalled strollers until the repair kit is installed. NOTE: When using a stroller, parents and caregivers are encouraged to always secure children by using the safety harness and never leave them unattended. To learn more about the importance of stroller safety, see CPSC's safety alert:www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/5096.pdf Strollers with one cup holder in the child tray (photos below) are included in this recall.Pliko-P3 StrollersVenezia StrollersPliko strollers with a front bumper or a child tray with two (2) cup holders (photos below) are not included in this recall</Description>

            <Hazard>
                <Name>Lamps can overheat, causing the adhesive inside the lamp socket to melt and migrate into the bulb area of the socket. The cooled glue can adhere to the light bulb base and make the bulb difficult to remove which can result in a broken light bulb, posing a risk of laceration to consumers. Melted flammable glue that migrates onto the electrical components of the lamp poses a risk of fire.</Name>

        <Injuries>
            <Injury>
                <Name>Roman Shades: CPSC received a new report of the death of a 22-month-old boy in Cedar Falls, Iowa who was found hanging by his neck from the outer pull cords of a Roman shade in May 2010. The outer pull cords were knotted at the bottom. He was rescued by his father but died later in the hospital. In March 2008, a 2-year-old boy from Ocean View, Delaware climbed up on a toy chest to look out of a window and became entangled in the inner cords of a Roman shade. His parents removed the cord. No permanent injuries were sustained. This incident prompted a previous recall.&amp;#x0D;

Clips that attach the tent to the top of the playard can break or be removed by a child. A child can lift the tent and become entrapped at the neck between the rigid playard frame and the metal base rod of the tent, posing a strangulation hazard. CPSC is aware of a death of a 2-year-old boy in December 2008 in Vinalhaven, Maine. The boy was found hanging with his neck entrapped between the playard frame and the metal base rod of the tent that had been partially tied by pieces of nylon rope and partially attached by clips. The tent was tied to the playard because the child was able to pop off the clips. Apparently, the child became entrapped while attempting to climb out of the playard. In three other incidents, children were able to remove one or more clips and place their necks between the tent and the playard. The children were not injured. The dome-shaped white-colored mesh tent is designed to fit over playards as small as 28 inches by 40 inches or as large as 31 inches by 44 inches to contain a child. There are 12 plastic clips to secure the base of the tent to the top rail of the playard through button holes along the bottom of the tent. The tent has a zippered side for putting in and taking out the child. This product was made in China and sold at Walmart, Amazon.com and various baby and childrenâ€™s stores nationwide from January 2005 through February 2010 for about $60. Consumers should immediately stop using the playard tents and contact Tots in Mind to get free replacement clips. Replacement clips will be available in late August or early September 2010. Contact Tots in Mind toll-free at (800) 626-0339 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday or visit the firmâ€™s website at --&gt;www.TotsinMind.com Note: Health Canada's press release is available at http://cpsr-rspc.hc-sc.gc.ca/PR-RP/recall-retrait-eng.jsp?re_id=110</Description>

        <Description>Child Craft Drop-Side Cribs Recalled Due to Entrapment, Suffocation and Fall Hazards Name of Product: Child Craft brand drop-side cribs Manufacturer: Child Craft Industries, Inc. (Child Craft ceased operations in July of 2009 and sold the "Child Craft" name to Foundations Worldwide Inc., of Medina, Ohio) Foundations Worldwide, Inc. neither manufactured nor sold any of the cribs included in this recall. Units: Unknown Hazard: The drop-side hardware can fail, causing the drop-side to detach from the crib or fall to the dropped position. When the drop side detaches, even partially, it creates a space in which an infant or toddler can become entrapped and suffocate or strangle. Drop side incidents can also occur due to incorrect assembly and with age related wear and tear. Additionally, when drop-side hardware fails and/or disengages, an infant or toddler can be injured by falling out of the crib. Incidents: CPSC has received seven reports of the drop side failing. In one of those reports, the child became entrapped in the gap created by the drop-side failure. In another incident, a child fell out of the crib and suffered bruises to his head when the drop side disengaged. Description: This recall involves drop-side Child Craft brand cribs using the style of drop-side hardware shown below. "Child Craft" appears on a label on the cribâ€™s frame and identifies the place of manufacture as Salem, Indiana or New Salisbury, Indiana. DROP-SIDE CRIBS MANUFACTURED BETWEEN 2000 and 2009 F10151 F10171 F10181 F10281 F13311 F13761 F16001 F16011 F16131 F16661 F17001 F17701 F17731 F17801 F17811 F20161 F20181 F20191 F21041 F21081 F21091 F26131 F27301 F27771 F31061 F31701 F32901 F33301 F33601 F33801 F33901 F34101 F35101 Sold at: Babies R Us, Sears, Burlington Coat Factory, Target, and various specialty stores nationwide between January 2000 and July 2009. Remedy: CPSC staff urges parents and caregivers to stop using these cribs immediately and find an alternative, safe sleeping environment for their baby. Do not attempt to fix these cribs. Although Foundations Worldwide did not manufacture or sell any of the recalled cribs, it has agreed to provide Child Craft owners with a rebate towards the purchase of a new, fixed-side Child Craft brand crib manufactured by Foundations Worldwide Inc.

        <Description>CPSC Announces Recall to Repair Child Craft Brand Stationary-Side Cribs with Dowel Due to Entrapment and Strangulation Hazards Name of Product: Child Craft brand "Crib 'N' Double Bed" full size stationary-side cribs with dowel Manufacturer: Child Craft Industries, Inc. (Child Craft ceased operations in July of 2009 and sold the "Child Craft" name to Foundations Worldwide Inc., of Medina, Ohio) Foundations Worldwide, Inc. neither manufactured nor sold any of the cribs included in this recall. Units: Between 40,000 and 50,000 Hazard: The cribs' stationary side can be assembled upside-down but still appear to be assembled correctly. If assembled upside-down, the crib side contains a hazardous five-inch gap at the top of the crib. Infants or toddlers can become entrapped in this gap (as depicted in the photo below), which can lead to entrapment, strangulation or other injuries. Incidents/Injuries: CPSC has received four reports of children becoming entrapped between the dowel and the crib's stationary front side. In two of those reports, the child was trapped by his/her head and was in danger of being strangled. In the other two reports, the child was trapped by his/her arm. This hazard can occur on both the front and back sides of the crib. Description: All Child Craft brand cribs with the foot top dowel (as shown in the photos below) including, but not limited to, the following models: Name Model Number(s) Child Craft convertible cribs F36101 The name "Child Craft" appears on a label on the crib's frame and identifies the place of manufacture as Salem, Indiana or New Salisbury, Indiana. These cribs were manufactured by Child Craft Industries, Inc., which is no longer in business. Sold at: Babies 'R Us and other stores nationwide between January 1998 and June 2009 for between $600 and $650. Remedy: The CPSC staff urges parents and caregivers to examine these cribs immediately and determine whether they have been assembled properly. The best way to do this is to measure the gap between the front and back sides of the crib and the dowel that runs parallel to the sides. The gap should be no more than two and three eighths inches (2 3/8"), as shown in the images below. If the gap is greater than 2 3/8", the side has been installed upside-down and needs to be re-assembled. Another indicator that the side has been installed improperly is the appearance of the barrel nut, as is visible in the image above showing an incorrect assembly. The barrel nut should be at the bottom of the side, not the top. If either of these conditions are present, the side of the crib has been installed upside-down and needs to be re-assembled so that the barrel nut is not visible from the top and the gap between the dowel and the side is no greater than two and three eighths inches (2 3/8"). Consumers with these cribs should contact Foundations Worldwide, Inc., to obtain instructions and decals to affix to the stationary sides of the crib to ensure proper assembly in the future. Consumer Contact: For additional information, contact Foundations Worldwide toll-free at (866) 614-0557 anytime, or visit the firm's website at www.cribsafetyinfo.com</Description>

        <Description>Originally issued February 9, 2010Revised March 29, 2010Release # 10-134 CPSC Recall Hotline: (800) 638-2772CPSC Media Contact: (301) 504-7908 This press release has been updated on March 29, 2010 to include portable drop-side cribs, and on September 30, 2010 to add a model number. Generation 2 Worldwide and "ChildESIGNS" Drop Side Crib Brands Recalled; Three Infant Deaths Reported WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is announcing the recall of all Generation 2 Worldwide and "ChildESIGNS" full-size and portable drop side cribs. CPSC is warning parents and caregivers who own these drop side cribs that infants and toddlers are at risk of serious injury or death due to strangulation and suffocation hazards presented by the cribs. CPSC staff urges parents and caregivers to stop using these cribs immediately and find an alternative, safe sleeping environment for their baby. Do not attempt to fix these cribs. The cribâ€™s plastic hardware can break which can cause the drop side of the crib to detach from a corner of the crib. When the drop side detaches, it creates a space into which an infant or toddler can roll and become wedged or entrapped. When a child is entrapped between the drop side and the crib mattress, it creates a risk of suffocation or strangulation. In addition, the cribâ€™s mattress support can detach from the crib frame, creating a hazardous space in which an infant or toddler could become entrapped and suffocate or strangle. CPSC has received reports of three infants who suffocated when they became entrapped between the crib mattress and the drop side when the drop side detached. In July 2007, an eight month old child from Newark, Ohio suffocated when he became entrapped between the drop side and the crib mattress. The drop side of his crib had detached due to a broken plastic stop tab on the lower track. In October 2003, an eight month old child from Richmond, Ind. suffocated when he became entrapped between the drop side and the crib mattress. The plastic hardware on the drop side was broken and allowed the drop side to detach from the crib headboard in one corner. In September 2002, a six month old from Staunton, Va. suffocated when he became entrapped between the drop side and crib mattress. The lower drop side track was missing two screws which allowed it to pull away from the headboard post and detach. CPSC has also received reports of 20 other drop side incidents, 12 of which involved the drop side detaching in a corner of the crib. In two of these incidents, a child became entrapped. One child suffered bruising from the entrapment. There are five reports of children falling out of the cribs due to drop side detachment. One child suffered a broken arm as a result of the fall. In addition, CPSC has received 8 reports of mattress support detachment in these cribs. Due to the space created by the detachment, three children became entrapped between the crib frame and the sagging mattress and four children crawled out of the crib. There was one report of cuts and bruises. Due to the fact that Generation 2 went out of business in 2005, CPSC has limited information about the cribs. Although CPSC does not know the total number of units distributed or the years of production, it is believed that there were more than 500,000 of these cribs sold to consumers. Some of the known model numbers are: 10-110X, 10-210X, 21-110X, 20-710X, 64-315X, 26-110X, 90-257X, 20-810X, 46-715X, 64-311X, 74-315X, 21-815X, 21-810X, 20815X, 308154, 54915, and 64-310X. (The "X" denotes where an additional and varying number may appear at the end of the model number.) However, all Generation 2 Worldwide and "ChildESIGNS" drop side cribs are included in this recall, including those with other model numbers. The name "Generation 2 Worldwide" appears on a label affixed to the cribâ€™s headboard or footboard. Some labels identify the place of manufacture as Dothan, Ala. Others identify China as the country of manufacture. The name "ChildESIGNS" appears on the teething rail of some of the cribs. The recalled cribs were sold at numerous local furniture and retail stores including Buy Buy Baby, and Kmart and Walmart stores nationwide for between $60 and $160. Consumers should contact the store from which they purchased the crib for remedy information, which will vary between a refund, replacement crib or store credit, depending on the retailer. Consumers are urged to contact CPSC and report any difficulties in obtaining a remedy from their place of purchase. Important Message from CPSC: CPSC would like to remind parents not to use any crib with missing, broken, or loose parts. Make sure to tighten hardware from time to time to keep the crib sturdy. When using a drop-side crib, parents should check to make sure the drop-side or any other moving part operates smoothly. Always check all sides and corners of the crib for disengagement. Any disengagement can create a gap and entrap a child. In addition, do not try to repair any side of the crib, especially with tape, wire or rope.

            WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the firm named below, today announced a voluntary recall of the following consumer product. Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise instructed. It is illegal to resell or attempt to resell a recalled consumer product. 
            Name of Product: Newport Energy Solution Roman Shades

            Retailer: Ross Stores Inc., of Pleasanton, Calif.
            Hazard: Strangulation can occur when a child places his/her neck between the exposed inner cord and the fabric on the backside of the blind or when a child pulls the cord out and wraps it around his/her neck.
            Incidents/Injuries: The shades involved in this recall are the same shades that were subject to Louis Hornick's previous recall. That recall was prompted by two reports of children becoming entangled in the exposed inner cord on the back of the shade sold by Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. In July 2008, while in his crib, a 20-month-old boy became entangled in the inner cord from a Roman shade. His grandfather responded to the child's cries and removed the cord that left a red mark on the right side of his neck. In April 2009, the mother of a 3-year-old boy found her crying son with a cord mark that ran ear to ear on the front of his neck. The boy was able to free himself after becoming entangled in the inner cord. This shade was also sold at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. No permanent injuries were sustained in these incidents and no injuries have been reported from the use of any shades sold by Ross stores.
            Description: This recall includes all sizes and colors of Newport Energy Solution Roman Shades sold by Ross Stores with exposed inner cords on the back. On the backside of the head rail, a small orange, black and white warning label sticker in English and Spanish which read in part, "Cords and bead chains can loop around child's neck and STRANGLE. Always keep cords ... to get to cords."
            Sold at: Ross Stores nationwide and from March 2009 through October 2009 for between $4 and $10.
            Manufactured in: China
            Remedy: Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled Roman shades and contact Louis Hornick &amp; Company to receive a free repair kit.
            Consumer Contact: For additional information, contact Louis Hornick &amp; Company at (877) 756-5102 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET daily, or visit the firm's Web site at www.hornickindustries.com

Strangulation Death of a Child Prompts Hill Sportswear To Recall Hooded Sweatshirts with Drawstrings WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is announcing today a voluntary recall by Hill Sportswear Inc., of Paramount, Calif., of approximately 120,000 hooded drawstring sweatshirts. CPSC received one report of a death involving a 3-year-old boy in Fresno, Calif. He was strangled when the drawstring on the hooded sweatshirt that he was wearing became stuck on a play ground set. The sweatshirts, Kid Pullover Hood Sweatshirt and Kid Zipper Sweatshirt with Hood, have drawstrings through the hood. The drawstrings should be removed immediately since they can become caught on objects and strangle a child. In February 1996, CPSC issued guidelines to help prevent children from strangling or getting entangled on the neck and waist drawstrings in upper garments, such as jackets or sweatshirts. The recall includes the Kid Pullover Hood and Kid Zipper with Hood. The Kid Pullover Hood has a flat style drawstring at the neck, one middle front pocket, and fleece inside lining. Top sewn in label reads "HILL/ Made in USA." The hooded Zipper children's sweatshirt has a rounded style drawstring at the neck, two front pockets, and fleece inside lining. Top sewn in label reads "HILL/ Made in USA". The recalled sweatshirts were sold at various small retailers in California and Texas from 2003 to December 2008 for approximately $8. Due to the serious nature of this hazard, parents are urged to immediately remove the drawstrings from the sweatshirts or return the garment to either the place of purchase or to Hill Sportswear for a full refund. Consumers should contact Hill Sportswear toll-free at (877) 322-8760 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. (PT) Monday through Friday</Description>

            Spin Master Recalls Aqua Dots - Children Became Unconscious After Swallowing Beads
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the firm named below, today announced a voluntary recall of the following consumer product. Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise instructed. It is illegal to resell or attempt to resell a recalled consumer product. 
            Name of Product: Aqua Dots
            Units: About 4.2 million
            Distributor: Spin Master, of Toronto, Canada
            Hazard: The coating on the beads that causes the beads to stick to each other when water is added contains a chemical that can turn toxic when many are ingested. Children who swallow the beads can become comatose, develop respiratory depression, or have seizures.
            Incidents/Injuries: CPSC has received two reports over the past several days of children swallowing Aqua Dots. A 20-month-old child swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time, was hospitalized, and has since fully recovered. A second child also vomited and slipped into a comatose state and was hospitalized for five days.
            Description: The recalled toy is a craft kit which allows children to create various multi-dimensional designs using small colored beads. The beads fuse together when sprayed with water. The recall applies to all models of Aqua Dots. The product is available in various different kits with accessories such as a drying fan, applicator pen, design templates for the beads, and spray bottle. The product is labeled for ages 4+.
            Sold at: Mass merchandisers nationwide from April 2007 through November 2007 for between $17 and $30.
            Manufactured in: China
            Remedy: Consumers should immediately take the recalled toy away from children and contact Spin Master to return for free replacement beads or a toy of equal value.
            Consumer Contact: For additional information, contact Spin Master at (800) 622-8339 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or visit the firm's Web site at www.aquadotsrecall.com</Description>

            Hazard: The garments have a drawstring through the hood, posing a strangulation hazard to children.

The words "BKLYN Xpress" and "Brooklyn Xpress" and various graphic designs are embroidered on the sweatshirts. A sewn-in tag has one of the following style numbers: BXFL72B, BXFL73B, BXFL74B, BXFL75B, BXFL77B or BXFL80B. This recall only involves sweatshirts in sizes 8 to 12.
            Sold at: Various clothing stores, including Ross Stores &amp; Gordman's, from September 2006 through December 2006 for about $25.
            Manufactured in: China 
            Remedy: Consumers should immediately remove the drawstrings from the sweatshirts to eliminate the hazard or return the garment to the store where purchased for help in removing the drawstring. Customer Contact: For additional information, contact Seena International toll-free at (866) 927-5596 between 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or visit the firm's Web site at www.brooklynxpress.com

            Important Note: There is an update to this recall, which can be found by clicking here 
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the firm named below, today announced a voluntary recall of the following consumer product. Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise instructed. It is illegal to resell or attempt to resell a recalled consumer product. 
            Name of Product: All Magnetix Magnetic Building Sets
            Units: About 3.8 million
            Importer: Rose Art Industries Inc., of Livingston, N.J.
            Hazard: Tiny magnets inside the plastic building pieces and rods can fall out. Magnets found by young children can be swallowed or aspirated. If more than one magnet is swallowed, the magnets can attract to each other and cause intestinal perforation or blockage, which can be fatal. This product is unsuitable for young children.
            Incidents/Injuries: CPSC is aware of 34 incidents involving small magnets, including one death and four serious injuries. A 20-month-old boy died after he swallowed magnets that twisted his small intestine and created a blockage. Three children ages ranging from 3 to 8 had intestinal perforations that required surgery and hospitalization in intensive care. A 5-year-old child aspirated two magnets that were surgically removed from his lung.
            Description: All Magnetix magnetic building sets including the X-treme Combo, Micro, and Extreme sets. The sets contain 20 to 200 plastic building pieces and 20 to 100 1/2-inch diameter steel balls. The building pieces are red, yellow, blue and green, and are shaped in 1 1/2-inch squares, 1-inch triangles and cylinder rods. Some plastic building pieces have "Magnetix" imprinted on them.
            Sold at: Wal-Mart, Target, Toys R Us, Fred Meyer, Design Science Toys Ltd., A.C. Moore, and other toy and arts and crafts stores nationwide. The Magnetix magnetic building sets were sold from September 2003 through March 2006 for between $20 and $60, depending on the size of the set. The replacement program does not include sets at retail.
            Manufactured in: China
            Remedy: Consumers should stop using the magnetic sets and return the sets to Rose Art for a free replacement product suitable for young children under the age of 6. Consumers should be sure to keep all small magnet parts out of the hands of children who mouth objects, especially children under the age of three. 
            Consumer Contact: For additional information, contact Rose Art at (800) 779-7122 between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or visit Rose Art's Web site at www.roseart.com</Description>

            Hazard: The garments have a drawstring through the hood, posing a strangulation hazard to children.

CPSC was alerted to this hazard by the state of Wisconsin.
            Incidents/Injuries: None reported.
            Description: The recalled garments are various color jackets, coats, sweatshirts and sweaters sold in youth sizes up to size 12 with drawstrings through the hood. Many of the sweatshirts have the names of colleges and universities written on them. A tag sewn on the garment reads, "Steve &amp; Barry's Quality Athletic Goods." The style numbers are 15178, 16105, 16168, 16230, 16231, 16257, 16509, 17197, 17285 and 18346, which is written on a collar or side label. 
            Sold at: Steve &amp; Barry's University Sportswear stores nationwide from January 2004 through December 2005 for between $6 and $10. 
            Manufactured in: China, India, Pakistan and Macau
            Remedy: Consumers should remove the drawstrings to eliminate the hazard or return the garment to the store where purchased for a refund.

            CPSC, Meijer Inc. Announce Recall of Children's Jackets
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Meijer Inc., of Grand Rapids, Mich., is voluntarily 
            recalling about 7,500 children's jackets. These jackets have hood 
            drawstrings. Children can get entangled and strangle in the drawstrings 
            that catch on objects, including playground equipment, fences and tree 
            branches. CPSC knows of numerous deaths from neck/hood drawstrings. To 
            help prevent children from strangling by their clothing drawstrings, in 
            1996 CPSC issued guidelines for drawstrings on children's outerwear (pdf), 
            which were subsequently incorporated into a voluntary standard. 
            Meijer has not received any reports of incidents. This recall is 
            being conducted to prevent the possibility of injuries. 
            The recalled Falls Creek Army Flight Jackets are for boys size 4 
            through 7 and 8 through 18, as well as toddlers sizes 2T through 5T. 
            These jackets are made of blue or olive nylon fabric and are decorated 
            with assorted patriotic patches on the sleeves, chest and back. The 
            hood is bordered with synthetic brown and tan fur. These jackets were 
            manufactured in Korea. 
            Meijer stores in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky 
            sold the jackets from July 2003 through October 2003 for between $26 and 
            $33. 
            Consumers should stop their children from wearing the jacket 
            immediately and contact Meijer toll-free at (866) 280-8419 anytime or 
            log on to their Web site at www.meijer.com for information on how to 
            return the jacket for a full refund. Parents also can remove the 
            drawstring, which will make the jacket safe for children to wear.</Description>

The "Amazing Babyâ„¢ Listen and Play" book has a multi-colored cover with a baby face on the front and is an interactive book designed to allow children ages 12 to 24 months to learn about different sounds, images, and materials. The cover also shows a yellow bird that makes a squeak noise when pressed, and a clear plastic container of multicolored beads. Mounted onto the inside back cover is a small rotating plastic wheel with finger indentations, which makes a "clacking" sound when turned. Retail stores, national book chains, wholesalers and distributors, and membership warehouse clubs nationwide sold the activity books from May through October 2003 for $16. Consumers should immediately take these books away from young children. Consumers should call Advantage Publishers Group toll-free at (866) 748-3731 anytime to order a replacement activity book without the dial.

            CPSC, Starbucks Coffee Co. Announce Recall of Children's Tumbler Cups
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Starbucks Coffee Co., of Seattle, Wash., is 
            voluntarily recalling approximately 38,000 plastic Bearista? Bear 
            tumbler cups. When the flexible straw on the cups is chewed, small 
            pieces of plastic can detach, posing a choking hazard to young children. 
            Starbucks has received two reports of pieces of the straws 
            becoming detached in the children's mouths. No injuries have been 
            reported; however, in one instance, a child reportedly began to choke on 
            a detached piece of the straw and the Heimlich Maneuver was administered 
            by the parent to remove the small piece. 
            The tumbler cup is constructed of translucent plastic in the shape 
            of a bear with the words "Bearista? Bear" printed on the front. The 
            cup was sold in both blue and green. The cup has a screw-on lid in the 
            shape of a bear's head, from which a soft, flexible straw protrudes. 
            The product's lid can rotate such that the straw attachment can be bent 
            (closed) to prevent liquid from leaking out. 
            Starbucks stores in the United States, Canada and Taiwan sold the 
            recalled cups from April 2003 through May 2003 for approximately $7 
            (U.S.). 
            Parents and caregivers should stop young children from using these 
            cups immediately, and return the cups to any Starbucks location for a 
            refund and a free beverage of any size. For more information, consumers 
            should contact Starbucks Customer Relations at (800) 235-2883 between 9 
            a.m. and 6 p.m. ET any day, or visit the company's Web site at 
            Starbucks.com or Starbuckscollectibles.com for more information. Consumers may also write to Starbucks Coffee Company at Customer 
            Relations, Starbucks Coffee Company, mailstop S-RC1, P.O. Box 3717,

            voluntarily recalling for repair about 37,000 girls' iridescent, hooded 
            winter jackets. The rubber petal and metal snap can break off of the 
            jacket, posing a choking hazard to young children. 
            S. Rothschild has received two reports of the rubber petal coming 
            off the jacket, including one child who reportedly put the petal in her 
            mouth. The snaps have come off in subsequent testing.

            12913K, B2913, 32813, 12816C, 3281J, 82819D, 82816D, and 32816C. The 
            jacket labels include the words, "Little Impressions," "Rothschild," 
            "Izzi's Kids," or "Clockwise." The recalled jackets were made in India. 
            Major retail stores nationwide sold the jackets from May 2002 
            through December 2002 for about $25 to $45.

            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Random House Inc., of New York, N.Y., is voluntarily 
            recalling about 360,000 children's board book sets. The book sets were 
            sold in cardboard boxes with plastic snaps. The plastic snaps can 
            detach, posing a choking hazard to young children. 
            CPSC and Random House have not received any reports of injuries 
            involving these book sets. This recall is being conducted to prevent the 
            possibility of injuries. 
            The boxed sets included in the recall have children's characters 
            on the front of the box, a colored plastic handle and plastic snaps. 
            The book set titles are "MONSTERS TO GO!," "DISNEY PRINCESS - DISNEY THE 
            PRINCESS COLLECTION 2," "DISNEY'S WINNIE THE POOH - A VERY MERRY

            four board books inside. Only book sets with plastic snaps are included 
            in the recall. Book sets with metal snaps are not part of the recall. 
            Book, discount department stores and online retailers sold the 
            recalled books nationwide from August 2002 through January 2003 for 
            about $10. 
            Consumers should immediately cut off the lid of the box with the 
            plastic snaps and throw away the rest of the box. Send the lid with the 
            plastic snaps to Tri-State, c/o Anthony Armetta, 325 Rabro Drive,

            CPSC, Pace Products Inc. Announce Recall of Children's Soap Making Kits 
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Pace Products Inc., of Apopka, Fla., is voluntarily 
            recalling about 145,000 children's soap making kits. The soap may get 
            too hot when heated in the microwave oven and leak from the tray mold 
            posing a burn hazard to children. 
            CPSC has received three reports of burn injuries from the heated 
            soap, including a 6-year-old girl who received burns to her hand.
            The soap kits were sold under the name 'Soap Making for Kids." The 
            kits include a plastic mold tray, three bars of glycerine, string and an 
            instruction book. "SCHOLASTIC INC." and "Made in U.S.A." are printed on 
            the back of the soap kit box. 
            Scholastic Book Clubs and Book Fairs sold the recalled soap kits 
            at schools nationwide from March 2000 through November 2002 and 
            bookstores sold the recalled soap kits from March 1998 through November 
            2002 for about $8. 
            Consumers should take these soap kits away from children 
            immediately and contact Pace Products at (800) 541-7670 between 8 a.m. 
            and 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday to receive instructions on returning 
            the soap kits for a refund. Consumers also can visit the firm's web site

            CPSC, Kohl's Department Stores Inc. Announce Recall of Children's Fleece Pant Sets
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Kohl's Department Stores Inc., of Menomonee Falls, 
            Wis., is voluntarily recalling about 9,600 children's fleece, two-piece 
            pant sets. Small pieces of fabric at the end of the sleeves, along the 
            hem and on the pockets of the tops can be torn off easily, posing a 
            choking hazard. 
            Kohl's Department Stores Inc. has received two reports of young children 
            putting torn pieces of fabric in their mouths. One child reportedly 
            began to choke on a piece of material. 
            The recall includes the First Moments- or Second Step-brand two-piece 
            pants set. The brand name is written on a label inside the tops of the 
            set. The set's pink fleece top has two patch pockets and the cotton 
            pants have a pink floral print. The set came in sizes 3 months to 24 
            months. The set has a cut-out floral pattern in the fabric at the end of 
            the sleeves, along the hem of the top and along the top of each pocket. 
            The part of the fabric subject to the cutting has been weakened and 
            tears easily from the rest of the garment. 
            Kohl's Department Stores sold the pant set nationwide from September 
            2002 through early November 2002 for about $18. 
            Consumers should stop using the set immediately and return it to the 
            store where purchased for a refund. For more information, call Kohl's 
            toll-free at (800) 694-2647 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. CT Monday 
            through Friday or visit the firm's web site at www.Kohls.com.</Description>

            Commission (CPSC), Damo Plus Corp., of Vernon, Calif., is voluntarily 
            recalling about 26,000 10-piece school supply sets. The sets contain 
            razor knives, which pose a laceration hazard to children. 
            Damo Plus has not received any reports of injuries from these 
            pencil sets. This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility 
            of injury. 
            The school supply sets were sold in 8-inch plastic cases. The sets 
            included the razor knife, pencils, scissors, a ruler, an eraser, a 
            compass, and a tube of glue. Writing on the plastic cases includes 
            "LITTLE WHITE," "LITTLE ARTIST," "GOOD FRIENDS," or "ZHONG BAIO REN." 
            The cases are blue, pink yellow or purple and have pictures of children 
            or animals. These sets were sold in plastic bags with cardboard headers 
            marked "10 PCS SET PENCIL CASE &amp; PENCIL HOLDER," and "MADE IN CHINA." 
            Discount and dollar stores in California, Texas, Washington, and 
            Maryland sold the sets between June and October 2002 for about $1. 
            Consumers should immediately take these razor knives away from 
            children and return the pencil sets to the store where they purchased 
            them for a refund. For more information about this recall, consumers 
            should call Damo Plus Corp. collect at (323) 583-8484 between 8 a.m. and

            CPSC, Hilton Hotels Corporation Announce Recall of Vacation Stationâ„¢ 
            Children's Cooler/Chairs
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Hilton Hotels Corporation, of Beverly Hills, Calif., 
            is voluntarily recalling about 27,000 Vacation Stationâ„¢ children's 
            cooler/chairs. When the chair collapses the folding mechanism can pose a 
            crushing, cutting or severing hazard to consumers' fingers. 
            CPSC and Hilton Hotels are aware of one report in which part of a 
            2-year-old boy's fingertip was severed when the chair collapsed. 
            The recalled product is a multi-use product that can be used as 
            both a child's chair or a food/beverage storage cooler. The 
            cooler/chairs were given to hotel guests as a welcoming gift at 
            participating HiltonÂ®, DoubletreeÂ®, and Hilton Garden InnÂ® hotels 
            and resorts. The chairs have either a purple aluminum frame with a 
            purple fabric seat and green cooler bag, or a green aluminum frame with 
            a green fabric seat and a blue cooler bag. Vacation Stationâ„¢ is 
            printed on the front of the cooler bag. The chairs were made in Hong 
            Kong and imported into the U.S. by Promotional Partners Group Limited of 
            Hong Kong. 
            Participating HiltonÂ®, DoubletreeÂ®, and Hilton Garden InnÂ®

            CPSC, Disney Children's Book Group, LLC Announce Recall of Children's Book
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Disney Children's Book Group, LLC, also known as 
            Disney Press, of New York, N.Y., is voluntarily recalling about 5,180 
            Zowie's 123 children's books. The books have a plastic abacus-like toy 
            attached to the back cover that contains five plastic beads. The beads 
            can separate from the book cover, posing a choking hazard to young 
            children. 
            Disney-Press has received one report of a 15-month-old boy who 
            broke a bead from the book cover and placed it in his mouth. An adult 
            was able to remove the bead from the child's mouth without injury. 
            The Zowie's 123 book is a twelve page white board book that 
            measures 6.5-inches by 6.5-inches with a yellow plastic abacus-like toy 
            attached to the back book cover. The abacus toy has five small beads: 
            blue, green, red, yellow and orange. The beads slide along a plastic 
            track. The book is based on the Rolie, Polie, Olie television series and 
            depicts the Zowie character on its cover. The book can be identified 
            with the ISBN code number 078683307-6, found on the back cover in the 
            bottom corner. 
            Bookstores nationwide sold the recalled books from January 2002 
            through February 2002 for about $7. 
            Consumers should immediately take these recalled books away from 
            young children and return the books to Disney Press for a full refund 
            and postage. Mail the books to Disney Press, Attn: Zowie 123, 114 Fifth 
            Avenue, New York, NY 10011 and use six first-class stamps per book. Be 
            sure to include a return address and phone number. For additional 
            information, contact Disney Children's Book Group, LLC toll-free at

            antenna ball breaking off of the toy phones. No injuries have been 
            reported. WHAT TO DO: Consumers should stop using the toy phone immediately and

            Baseball Caps PRODUCT: Children's Baseball Caps - Recreational Equipment Inc. of Kent, 
            Wash., is voluntarily recalling about 1,600 REI Kids Super Caps. The 
            caps are sold in three colors (New Denim, Pumpkin or Lichen) with the 
            letters "REI" embroidered on the back left side of the cap and a 
            decorative compass embroidered on the front center of the cap. There is 
            a size-adjustment cord, located on the rear of the cap that has two 
            parts; a black toggle and a black snap-on plastic pull. The caps were 
            sold nationwide at retail stores, mail order catalogs and on the

            PROBLEM: The adjustment cords, located on the rear of the hats, use a 
            snap-on plastic pull. The snap-on plastic pull could separate from the 
            cord, posing a choking hazard to young children. INCIDENTS/INJURIES: REI Product Quality Assurance (PQA) received one 
            report of a parent finding the snap-on plastic pull in the mouth of her

            stitching around the pockets. The pants have an elastic waistband and an 
            elastic draw-cord. A label on the rear inside seam reads "Koala Baby" or 
            "Little Legends" and the care label reads in part "Made in Thailand."

            38,800 children's sidewalk bicycles. The frames of these bikes can

            The recall includes bicycles having date codes of April 2000 and 
            earlier. The date code is molded on the bicycles' left rear frame, at 
            the point of attachment of the rear wheel. The model name is written on 
            the bike's frame. The following models are involved:

            "Sweet Tweety", 12-inch girl's style

            Ace Hardware, Ames, Blain Supply, Kay Bee Toys, Meijers, Tru*Serv and 
            Wal-Mart, sold these bikes nationwide from October 1999 through March 
            2001 for between $35 and $70. 
            Consumers should stop riding these bicycles immediately, and call

            CPSC, Firms Announce Recall of Chain Saws and Child Table Seats PRODUCT: Chain Saws - Stihl Inc., of Virginia Beach, Va., is voluntarily 
            recalling about 1,000 chain saws. The recalled chain saws are model 
            number 019T with serial numbers 249129398 through 249956311. A label on 
            the chain saw reads in part "STIHL" and "model number 019T." The serial 
            number is imprinted on the front of the chain saw. Stihl dealers sold 
            the chain saws from December 2000 through May 5, 2001 for about $270. PROBLEM: A missing screw can cause the chain brake to fail to operate, 
            presenting a laceration hazard to consumers. INCIDENTS/INJURIES: None reported. WHAT TO DO: Consumers should stop using the recalled chain saw 
            immediately and return it to the Stihl dealer where purchased for 
            repair. For more information, contact Stihl Inc. at 
            (800) 467-8445 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Consumers also 
            can visit the firm's web site at www.stihlusa.com.
            PRODUCT: Child Table Seats - Inglesina USA Inc., of Montclair, N.J., is 
            voluntarily recalling about 780 child table seats. The recalled table 
            seat has a metal frame with a fabric cover, and connects to the edge of 
            a table to allow a child to sit and eat at the table. The table seat 
            does not have legs; instead, it is suspended in the air by clamps that 
            connect to the underside of the table. The chairs come in blue and 
            yellow and have the name "Inglesina" printed on the arms and the back of 
            the seat. Department stores and toy stores sold the Table Chair from 
            June 2000 through May 2001 for about $50. PROBLEM: The seats were sold without a seat belt, posing a risk to 
            children who climb out of the seat. INCIDENTS/INJURIES: Inglesina USA has received one report of a 10-month-
            old girl who fell from a table seat, and bruised her back. WHAT TO DO: Consumers should immediately stop using the seats and call 
            Inglesina USA toll-free at (877) 486-5112 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET 
            Monday through Friday, to receive a replacement or a full refund.</Description>

            CPSC, Child Craft Industries Announce Recall of Changing Tables
            WASHINGTON, D.C.- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Child Craft Industries, of Salem, Ind., is 
            voluntarily recalling about 4,300 changing tables. Some changing table 
            joints were not properly glued and can separate, presenting a fall 
            hazard to babies. 
            Child Craft has received six reports of the changing tables 
            falling apart, including one report of a baby starting to fall from a 
            collapsing table when she was caught by her mother. No injuries have 
            been reported. 
            The changing table is made of beech wood and comes in a variety of 
            colors including white, honey oak, natural and cherry finishes. The 
            table measures about 38 inches high by 35 inches wide by 20 inches deep. 
            There are two labels on one of the rails of the changing table. One 
            label is gold and reads in part "Child Craft Industries" and the other 
            label is stamped in black ink and reads in part "FoppsPedretti, Made in 
            Italy." 
            Department and specialty stores nationwide, including Sears and 
            Burlington Coat Factory, sold the changing tables from August 1998 
            through April 2001 for about $150. 
            Consumers should stop using the recalled changing tables 
            immediately and call Child Craft at (877) 716-2757 between 8:30a.m. and 
            5:30 p.m. ET Monday through Friday to receive information on 
            participating in this recall.</Description>

            CPSC, Gymboree Announce Recall of Children's Fleece Pants 
            WASHINGTON, D.C.- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), The Gymboree Corp. (GymboreeÂ®), of Burlingame, 
            Calif., is voluntarily recalling about 125,000 children's fleece pants. 
            The cord locks on the pants can break off, posing a choking hazard to 
            young children. 
            Gymboree has received one report of a cord lock that broke off, and was 
            found in a child's mouth. The child's parent was present and removed 
            the lock from the child's mouth. No injuries have been reported.
            The recalled pants have blue, gray, red, or green pant legs, with 
            stitching around the knees. The pants have a gray elastic waistband and 
            black elastic drawcord that hold up the children's pants. The drawcord 
            is secured in place with two plastic cord locks. A label on the back 
            pocket says "Gymboree," and the care label inside the pants says "Made 
            in Indonesia" and "2000 Gymboree." The fleece pants were sold in sizes 
            0-3T. 
            Gymboree's website and stores nationwide sold these pants from September 
            2000 through February 2001 for about $15. 
            Consumers should take these pants away from children immediately and 
            return them to any Gymboree store for a full refund. For more 
            information, call Gymboree toll-free at (800) 222-7758 between 9 a.m. 
            and 5 p.m. PT Monday through Friday, or log on to the company's website

            CPSC, National Shooting Sports Foundation Announce Recall to Replace Project HomeSafe (Now Project ChildSafe) Gun Locks
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), of 
            Newtown, Conn., is voluntarily recalling about 400,000 gun locks for 
            replacement. Under certain conditions, these locks can open without the 
            use of a key. This can give unauthorized access to a firearm. 
            The NSSF and its lock supplier, Adstar Inc., of Merrick, N.Y., are 
            unaware of any instances of unauthorized access by adults or children. 
            The locks resemble a bicycle cable lock and have a red cable with 
            a black padlock. Red vinyl bands around the top and bottom of the locks 
            read, "PROJECT" and "HOMESAFE." "MADE IN CHINA" and "30mm" are imprinted 
            on the bottom of the locks. The gun locks were distributed in clear 
            plastic cylinders with Project HomeSafe literature. 
            The gun locks were distributed nationwide by NSSF as part of its 
            Project HomeSafe (now Project ChildSafe) Campaign for safe firearm storage. Law enforcement 
            agencies distributed the gun locks free of charge from September 1999 
            through October 2000. 
            Recipients of the Project HomeSafe (now Project ChildSafe) gun locks should call (203) 426-1320 or (203) 270-2360 anytime to receive a free replacement gun lock. Until the 
            replacement gun lock is received, keep the original Project HomeSafe 
            lock installed on the firearm. Consumers are reminded to never put a gun 
            lock on a loaded gun, and to take extra precautions to make sure the gun 
            is secure to keep kids safe. 
            The replacement lock has an improved locking mechanism and a 
            thicker braided-steel cable. With the announcement of this replacement 
            lock program, NSSF is resuming Project HomeSafe (Now Project ChildSafe) and encourages 
            communities to enroll in the nationwide program 
            by having a law 
            enforcement official contact the NSSF. 
            NSSF urges consumers to comply with all state and local laws 
            requiring the use of gun locking devices. For more information on the 
            safe handling and storage of firearms, visit the Project ChildSafe website at www.projectchildsafe.org Consumers can also

            CPSC, Seattle Bike Supply Announce Recall of Children's Bicycles
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Seattle Bike Supply, of Kent, Wash., is voluntarily 
            recalling about 1,400 children's bicycles. Because the bikes' pedals are 
            too low to the ground, they fail to meet federal bicycle standards. 
            Children can lose control when a pedal strikes the ground, causing falls 
            and injuries. 
            Seattle Bike Supply has received one report of a 4-year-old boy whose 
            pedal struck the ground while riding one of these bikes causing him to 
            fall. No injuries were reported. 
            Bicycles that are part of this recall are all model-year 2001 Torker 
            Blaster 16-inch Boy's bicycles in red, black, blue, or chrome, and 
            Sunflower 16-inch Girl's bicycles in yellow, pink or florescent green. 
            The Torker brand name and the model names are on the frames. 
            Bicycle stores sold these bicycles nationwide from September 2000 
            through December 2000 for about $130. 
            Consumers should stop using the bicycles immediately, and return them to 
            the store where purchased for a free repair. For more information, call 
            Seattle Bike Supply at (800) 283-2453 anytime, or write to Seattle Bike 
            Supply, 7620 S. 192nd, Kent, WA 98032.</Description>

            CPSC and Designer Classics LLC Announce Recall of Children's Jeans and Overalls
            WASHINGTON, D.C.- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Designer Classics LLC, of Keasbey, N.J., is recalling 
            about 11,000 of its children's jeans and overalls manufactured under the 
            BABY GUESS and GUESS GIRLS label. The small decorative metal appliques 
            on the legs of the garments can come loose and separate, posing a 
            choking hazard to young children. 
            The company has received one report of a child mouthing a metal piece 
            that had separated from the garment. 
            The denim jeans and overalls were sold in sizes 6 months through 6X. 
            They have the following style numbers on the bottom of the care label: 
            KL11450, KH11448, JL21338, JH21408, and JH31288. "Made in Indonesia" and 
            the size is on the front of the care label. The BABY GUESS or GUESS 
            GIRLS label is above the care label. 
            Department and specialty stores nationwide sold the garments from 
            October 2000 to December 2000 for between $36 and $42. 
            Consumers should stop using these garments immediately and call the 
            company for instructions on returning the garment for another garment of 
            the same size. Consumers should contact the company toll-free at (888) 
            626-4939 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. Garments should 
            be sent to Designer Classics LLC, Attention: Recall, 22351 Wilmington 
            Ave., Carson, CA 90745. Consumers will be reimbursed for standard 
            postage.</Description>

            CPSC, Appliance Manufacturers Announce Voluntary Recall Initiative for Old Chest Freezers - A Deadly Play Area for Children
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
            (AHAM) and its refrigerator/freezer manufacturing members are announcing 
            a voluntary recall initiative to prevent suffocation deaths to children 
            who become trapped inside non-working chest freezers in homes. 
            Up to 9 million chest freezers were manufactured between 1945 and 
            1970 before voluntary safety standards went into effect allowing 
            freezers to be opened from the inside. Although some manufacturers had 
            freezers that were in compliance prior to the 1970 standards, most old 
            chest freezers have latches that can trap a child. Children playing 
            "hide-and-seek" have found the non-working freezers a deadly place to 
            hide. When the lid closes, children can become trapped inside and 
            suffocate - usually in less than ten minutes. 
            Consumers should properly dispose of these non-working freezers 
            immediately or disable the latch if disposal is impossible. AHAM has set 
            up a special toll-free number (800) 267-3138 from which consumers will 
            be sent detailed information on identifying the affected units and how 
            to dispose of them or disable the latch. Even if a consumer has a pre-
            1970 chest freezer that is working, they should still call the toll-free number to get information on what to do when the freezer is no longer working. Consumers also can receive information at http://www.aham.org/freezer_safety.htm. 
            Tragically, 27 children have died from suffocation between 1980 
            and 1999 after becoming trapped in the freezers. The deaths occurred in 
            non-working freezers stored outside, in basements or garages. Victims 
            ranged in age from two to fourteen. In many cases, more than one child 
            suffocated inside the freezer. 
            The freezers that are part of this program were made before 1970 
            by more than 40 manufacturers, a number of whom do not exist today. 
            Consumers can determine if their chest freezer poses a hazard by trying 
            to open the freezer without using the handle. If the freezer can be 
            opened by pulling up on sides of the lid, it is not a hazard. If the lid 
            only opens by using the handle, it needs to be properly disposed of or 
            disabled. 
            "Many of these old freezers are still sitting in people's 
            basements or abandoned in backyards," said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown. 
            "This is an innovative cooperative effort that helps get safety 
            information to consumers and saves lives." 
            "We are hopeful this partnership between manufacturers and the

            CPSC, Empire Industries Announce Recall of Children's Riding Vehicles
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Empire Industries, of Tarboro, N.C., recalled about 
            113,000 battery-powered children's riding vehicles, marketed as "Power Drivers" 
            or "Buddy L," for repair. The vehicles' battery chargers can overheat, 
            presenting fire and injury hazards to children. 
            CPSC and Empire have received about 100 reports of chargers overheating, 
            melting or burning. Five house fires have been reported resulting in at least 
            $100,000 in property damage. One child and one adult received burns to hands on 
            overheated charger jacks. 
            The Power Driver vehicles being recalled are powered by two 6-volt 
            batteries, and were manufactured from July 1995 to December 1996. The vehicles 
            are made of plastic and were sold under the following model names: Go-Kart, 
            Beach Splash, Sun Dream, Trail Tracker, Rescue Patrol, and Chevy Z-71 Pick-Up 
            Truck. The model name "Power Drivers" or "Buddy L" appear on each vehicle. The company will 
            help consumers identify if their model is part of the recall. Power Driver 
            vehicles are intended for children 3 to 8 years old, and the vehicles' speed 
            ranges from 2.5 to 5 mph, depending on the model. 
            Toy stores and retail catalogs sold the vehicles nationwide from July 1995 
            through December 1997 for about $130 to $250. 
            Consumers should stop using the vehicles immediately. Empire Industries is no longer in business and cannot provide charger adapters or other replacement parts. Consumers should discontinue use of these products, and discard or destory them.</Description>

            CPSC, Fisher-Price Announce Recall of Children's Riding Vehicles
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Fisher-Price, of East Aurora, N.Y., is recalling 
            about 218,000 battery-powered Power Wheels Harley-Davidson motorcycle 
            ride-ons for repair. The foot pedals, which activate the ride-ons, can 
            stick in the "on" position. Children can be injured when the motorcycle 
            ride-ons fail to stop and strike other objects. 
            Fisher-Price has received nine reports of the foot pedal on these 
            vehicles sticking. One 3-year-old boy suffered cuts and bruises when his 
            motorcycle ride-ons ran into a home. 
            The recalled Power Wheels Harley-Davidson motorcycle ride-ons have 
            model numbers 74290, 74293 (with a red body) and 74298 (with a black 
            body). A "Power Wheels by Fisher-Price" logo is located on the left 
            side of the seat on the product, and the model number is located on a 
            label in the battery compartment. Only model numbers 74290, 74293 and 
            74298 are being recalled. These vehicles are intended for children 3 and 
            older, and the vehicles' speed is 2.5 or 5 mph. 
            Toy, mass merchandise and discount stores, and Harley-Davidson 
            dealerships sold the motorcycle ride-ons nationwide from September 1999 
            through August 2000 for about $190 for the red vehicle and $700 for the 
            black vehicle. 
            Consumers should stop using these motorcycle ride-ons immediately, and 
            call Fisher-Price to determine if your vehicle is part of this recall. 
            Consumers with recalled ride-ons will receive a free foot pedal repair 
            kit. The repair can be easily completed in the home. Consumers should 
            call Fisher-Price at (888) 289-9292 anytime, or visit the Fisher-Price 
            web site at http://www.service.mattel.com/us/recall.asp for more information.
            Power Wheels Harley-Davidson motorcycle ride-ons that have model number 
            74370 (with a pink body) are not part of this recall.</Description>

            CPSC, Tek Nek Toys Announce Recall of Children's Riding Vehicles
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Tek Nek Toys, of Mokena, Ill., is recalling about 
            294,000 battery-powered children's riding vehicles to replace the 
            battery chargers. The vehicles' battery charger or wires can overheat, 
            presenting fire and injury hazards to children. 
            CPSC and Tek Nek have received 17 reports of battery chargers and 
            wires overheating, while vehicles were being charged. Two consumers 
            burned their hands while unplugging or charging the vehicles. 
            The Tek Nek vehicles being recalled are powered by one 6-volt 
            battery and were manufactured before April 2000. The vehicles are made 
            of plastic and were sold under the following model names: Prowler, Dodge 
            Ram, Corvette, SPX Motorcycle and Honda. The model name appears on each 
            vehicle. Some models have working lights and horn, engine and music 
            sounds. A label on the vehicle reads "MADE IN CHINA." Tek Nek vehicles 
            are intended for children 1-1/2 to 4 years old, and the vehicles' speed 
            ranges from 1 to 2 mph, depending on the model. 
            Toy stores and discount department stores sold the vehicles 
            nationwide from July 1998 through April 2000 for about $89. 
            Consumers should stop using the vehicles immediately and contact 
            Tek Nek at (888) 900-0155 between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. CT Monday through 
            Friday to receive a free, new charger. Consumers should not charge the

            voluntarily recalling about 120,000 boys baseball shirts and rompers. 
            The buttons can come off, posing a small parts choking hazard to young 
            children. 
            The Children's Place has received three reports of buttons 
            detaching. No injuries have been reported. 
            The recalled baseball shirts are grey, blue, white or red with 
            contrasting colors at the trim. They were available in boys sizes 3 to 
            36 months. The shirts have four baseball-shaped buttons down the front. 
            A tag at the neck reads in part, "The Children's Place, Made in Turkey". 
            On the left front of the shirt there is an embroidered baseball 
            surrounded by the words, "Baseball Place USA". "Place" and the number 
            "9" are embroidered on the back of the shirt. 
            The recalled one-piece rompers are grey, blue or red with 
            contrasting colors at the trim. They were available in boys sizes 3 to 
            36 months. The rompers have four baseball-shaped buttons down the front 
            and snaps around the crotch. A tag at the neck reads in part, "The 
            Children's Place, Made in Turkey". On the left front of the romper there 
            is an embroidered baseball surrounded by the words, "Baseball Place 
            USA". "Place" and the number "9" are embroidered on the back of the 
            romper. 
            The Children's Place stores nationwide sold the shirts and rompers 
            from January 2000 through July 2000. The shirts cost about $12 and the 
            rompers cost about $14. 
            Consumers should take these clothes away from their children 
            immediately. Consumers should return the clothes to the nearest The 
            Children's Place store for a full refund and a 10 percent discount 
            coupon. For more information, call The Children's Place at

            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Kmart Corp., of Troy, Mich., is recalling about 
            85,550 "Splash Club" swim masks for children. The mask's glass lens can 
            break into sharp pieces, causing lacerations to a child's face, eyes or 
            hands. 
            Kmart has received one report of the glass lens shattering. No 
            injuries have been reported.

            purple, aqua or lime-green plastic. It has a clear glass lens and an 
            adjustable head strap. "Tempered Splash Club Glass" is written on the 
            mask. The mask is packaged in clear plastic with a cardboard insert 
            labeled "Splash Club Aquatic Child's Swim Mask." The following UPC code 
            is on the package: 072000 72970 0. The mask was made in China. 
            Kmart and Super Kmart stores nationwide sold the swim masks from 
            February 2000 to July 2000 for about $3. 
            Consumers should stop using these swim masks immediately and

            CPSC, Child Guidance TM Announce Recall to Replace Caterpillar Toys
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Child Guidance TM, of New York, N.Y., a division of 
            JAKKS Pacific Inc., is voluntarily recalling almost 1 million Wiggle 
            Waggle Caterpillar TM toys. Young children can choke on the small balls 
            attached to these toys. 
            CPSC has received one report of a 5-month-old girl in El Paso, 
            Texas, choking to death after one of the small balls attached to these 
            toys lodged in her throat. CPSC also received reports of two children 
            starting to choke on a ball from this toy. 
            The Wiggle Waggle Caterpillar TM is a pull toy that plays four 
            songs and various sounds. It has five ball shapes raised from its body 
            on the end of tightly wound coil wire springs. The two smaller ball 
            shapes on the caterpillar's head resemble antennas. The toy is about 10 
            inches long, and is green with yellow oval wheels that cause it to 
            wobble when it moves. The segments of the caterpillar's body have lights 
            that flash to the music and sounds. "Child Guidance TM" and "MADE IN 
            CHINA" are imprinted on the bottom of the toy. "Ages 12 months &amp; up" is 
            written on the packaging. 
            Toy and discount department stores nationwide sold the caterpillar 
            toys from May 1998 through June 2000 for about $13. 
            Parents and caregivers should take these toys away from young 
            children immediately. Consumers should send the toy back to the firm to 
            receive another toy of similar value. The firm will pay postage costs. 
            For more information, call Child Guidance TM at (877) 586-1006 between 
            9 a.m. and 5 p.m. PT Monday through Friday or visit their web site at www.jakkspacific.com/recall.html.
            Consumers can also view a video clip about this recall (transcript). This is in "streaming video" format.</Description>

            CPSC, Shelcore Inc. Announce Recall Children's Play Tables to Replace Mallets
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Shelcore Inc., of Somerset, N.J., is voluntarily 
            recalling about 124,000 "Stand-Up 'N Play Tables" to replace the 
            xylophone mallets. The mallet that comes as part of this table set can 
            be lodged into the throats of young children, posing a choking hazard. 
            Shelcore received a report of the mallet being jammed into the 
            throat of a 13-month old boy after he fell while teething on the ball 
            end of the mallet. Lacerations in the throat resulted when an adult had 
            to forcibly remove the mallet to prevent choking. 
            The "Stand-Up 'N Play Table" measures 14 inches long, 14 inches 
            wide and 13 inches high. The multi-colored play table includes a 
            telephone, clicking dial, spinner, push-button squeaker, rolling ball, 
            spinning gears, xylophone and mallet, three colorful shapes, and a shape 
            sorter. The tray of the table is white, and the legs are red with yellow 
            caps at the base. Writing on the box reads, "Ages 9-36 Months," and 
            "Encourages Child to Pull-Up and Stand." 
            Toy stores nationwide sold these play tables from March 1996 
            through March 1999 for between $18 and $20. 
            Consumers should immediately throw the recalled mallets in the 
            trash, and call Shelcore for a free replacement mallet. For more 
            information, call Shelcore at (800) 777-0453 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
            ET Monday through Friday, or write to Shelcore Inc., 347 Elizabeth Ave.,

            CPSC, Jetmax International Ltd. Announce Recall to Repair Children's 
            Rocking Chairs Sold at Target Stores
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Jetmax International Ltd., of Stamford, Conn., is 
            voluntarily recalling to repair about 48,000 children's rocking chairs. 
            The rear legs of the chair can separate from the rocker's base causing 
            it to collapse, and the child seated in the chair can fall. 
            Jetmax has received five reports of these chairs collapsing and 
            children falling. One 13-month-old girl suffered a laceration requiring 
            18 stitches. 
            Jetmax imported the rocker exclusively for sale by Target stores. 
            The wooden rocking chairs come in two styles: one for boys and one for 
            girls. The boy's rocker has a yellow frame, red rockers (chair bases) 
            and a blue canvas seat. The girl's rocker has a white frame, purple 
            rockers (chair bases) and a pink canvas seat. There is no writing on the 
            chairs, but the packaging reads, "restore? &amp; RESTYLE KIDS," "Wooden 
            Folding Chair," "Ages 3 and Up," and "Made in China." The chairs are 
            designed for children between 30 and 100 pounds. They are 23 inches 
            long, 13 inches wide and 16.5 inches high. 
            Target stores nationwide sold the rocking chairs from November 
            1999 through March 2000 for about $20. 
            Consumers should immediately stop using these rockers, and contact 
            Jetmax International to get a free repair kit with easy installation 
            instructions. For more information and to get the repair kit, call 
            Jetmax International at (800) 880-0714 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET 
            Monday through Friday.</Description>

            CPSC, Kmart Corp. Announce Recall of Children's Lamps
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Kmart Corp., of Troy Mich., is voluntarily recalling 
            about 280,000 children's decorative lamps. The lamps can short circuit 
            posing a fire hazard. 
            Kmart has received eight reports of the lamps short circuiting and 
            catching fire, resulting in property damage. One of these fires resulted 
            in more than $15,000 in damages, and another caused more than $3,000 in 
            damages. No injuries or deaths have been reported. 
            The "Little Ones" wooden accent lamps being recalled come in six 
            different styles: an airplane lamp, alphabet letters (ABC) lamp, numbers 
            (123) lamp, baseball with bat lamp, train lamp and sailboat lamp. The 
            lamps are approximately 15 inches high with wood bases. A price label on 
            the bottom of the base reads, "Made in China for Kmart Corporation." 
            "Little Ones fun accent lamps for kids" is written on a paper insert 
            packaged on the lampshade. 
            Kmart stores nationwide sold the lamps from January 1993 through March 
            2000 for between $13 and $15. 
            Consumers should immediately unplug the lamps and stop using them. 
            Consumers should return the lamps to their local Kmart for a refund. For

            CPSC, Kelty Announce Recall to Repair Backpack Child Carriers
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Kelty, of Boulder, Colo., is recalling for repair 
            approximately 26,000 Kelty K.I.D.S. backpack child carriers. The seat 
            height adjustment strap on these carriers can slip out of the buckle. A 
            child can slide downward in the seat unexpectedly and could fall out of 
            the carrier. 
            Kelty has received two reports of children slipping down inside 
            the carriers after the height adjustment strap came loose. Neither child 
            fell out of the carrier, and there were no reports of injury. 
            There are six models of these Kelty K.I.D.S backpack carriers: 
            Expedition, Trek, Explorer, Country, Elite and Town. The model name is 
            written on the side of the carrier. The carriers are blue and have the 
            Kelty K.I.D.S. logo on the back rest of the seat. Kelty also 
            manufactured a carrier that L.L. Bean sold under its "L.L. KIDS" label 
            and has the "Kelty" logo on the black frame hinge that connects the 
            kickstand to the main frame. 
            Specialty and sporting good retailers, including L.L. Bean, REI 
            and Eastern Mountain Sports, sold the recalled backpack carriers 
            nationwide from March 1999 through December 1999 for between $100 and 
            $250. 
            Consumers should immediately stop using these backpack carriers, 
            and contact Kelty for instructions on getting the free repair kit. For 
            more information, consumers should call Kelty at (800) 423-2320 between 
            10:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or go to Kelty's web 
            site at www.kelty.com. 
            Kelty and L.L. KIDS carriers purchased prior to March 1999 have a 
            different type of seat adjustment strap and are not included in this 
            recall.

            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Little Me, Cumberland, Md., is recalling 
            approximately 7,200 newborn and infant garments described as Mini Fruit 
            Girl's Rompers. The attached ornamental cherries on these garments pose 
            a choking hazard to young children. 
            Little Me is aware of one incident in which a child started to 
            choke on one of the ornamental cherries. It was pulled from the child's 
            throat by the attached string. 
            These 100 percent cotton garments have a white top and cherry 
            print bottom, with white embroidered collar, and were sold with a floppy 
            hat with cherry print material. The outfits have ornamental cherries 
            attached to a string at the waist. They were sold in sizes 3M, 6M, 9M, 
            12M, 18M and 24M. The collar labels read, "Little Me," "MADE IN 
            PHILIPPINES" and "RN 20864." 
            Major department and children clothing stores sold these garments 
            from March 1999 through July 1999 for about $20 to $22. 
            Consumers should immediately stop using these garments, and should 
            return them to Little Me for a refund and a voucher for a 30 percent 
            rebate on a future Little Me purchase. For more information, call 
            Little Me at (301) 729-4488 x. 1350, anytime, or visit the Little Me web site at

            CPSC, Reebok Announce Recall of Children's Side Zip Sneakers
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Reebok International Ltd., of Stoughton, Mass., is 
            recalling about 140,000 children's side zip sneakers. The sneaker's side 
            pocket has a pull tab on the zipper that can be twisted off, presenting 
            a choking and ingestion hazard to children. 
            CPSC and Reebok are not aware of any injuries from these sneakers. 
            This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. 
            The sneakers being recalled are the Reebok Classic Leather Zip, 
            sold in toddler and child sizes up to size 9. Each sneaker has a small 
            zippered pocket on the side. The zipper's pull tab is imprinted with the 
            Reebok name and logo. When unzipped, the Reebok name and logo appear. 
            "Reebok Classic" is on the front of the sneaker's tongue. The sneakers 
            are made in Indonesia and China. The sneakers come in the following

        <Description>June 24, 1999 Release # 99-127 WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and 15 firms are announcing the recall of more than 19 million dive sticks used in swimming pools. In shallow water, children can fall or land on a dive stick and suffer rectal or vaginal impalement. Facial and eye injuries also are possible when children attempt to retrieve the sticks under water. According to CPSC Chairman Ann Brown, these dives sticks are dangerous and should not be used. CPSC knows of six impalement injuries and one facial injury to children 6 to 9 years old. Although the number of reported incidents is relatively low, the severity of the injuries that have occurred is very significant. Three of the children suffered rectal and three suffered vaginal impalements from dive sticks placed in backyard pools or, in one case, a hot tub. In four of the six incidents, the injuries that occurred required surgery and hospitalization. The facial injury occurred when a child bobbed down to retrieve a dive stick and lacerated her face just below her eye, requiring stitches. The dive sticks being recalled are hard plastic and are either cylinder-shaped or shark-shaped. When dropped into water, the dive sticks sink to the bottom of a pool and stand upright so that children can swim or dive down and retrieve them. The cylinder-shaped plastic sticks measure about 4 to 8 inches long and about 1 inch or less in diameter. The shark-shaped plastic sticks measure about 7 inches long and have an egg-shaped bottom. The sticks come in a variety of colors. Most are packaged in kits of three to six sticks, and some are packaged with other pool diving games. These dive sticks have been sold at grocery, drug, pool and discount department stores nationwide for about $4 to $7 per set under numerous brand names, most of which do not appear on the dive stick itself. Consumers should stop using dive sticks immediately and throw them out.Depending on the sticks owned, consumers can receive a refund, replacement or repair.

            CPSC, Crate &amp; Barrel Announce Recall to Repair Children's Table
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
            Commission (CPSC), Crate &amp; Barrel, of Northbrook, Ill., is recalling for 
            repair about 4,300 children's tables. These tables have a 6-inch hole 
            cut in the center. Children can stick their heads into these holes and 
            become stuck. Head entrapment can be painful and it can be difficult to 
            free the child. 
            Crate &amp; Barrel has received four reports of children becoming 
            entrapped in the table openings. Two children required emergency 
            personnel to free them. 
            The 27-inch by 27-inch table is natural hardwood. In the center of 
            the table is a round opening fitted with a hanging red canvas bag to 
            hold toys. A red wooden disc with a small hole is provided as a lid for 
            the receptacle. The tables were sold individually or as a set with two 
            chairs. 
            The children's tables were sold in Crate &amp; Barrel stores 
            nationwide and through the Crate &amp; Barrel 1998 Holiday catalog between 
            September 1998 and February 1999 for about $75 for the table alone and 
            $135 for the table and chair set. 
            Consumers should stop using these tables until the repair is made. 
            To prevent a head entrapment, Crate &amp; Barrel will provide a free repair 
            disc that will permanently close the hole. Consumers should call Crate 
&amp; Barrel at 800-897-5919 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. CDT Monday through 
            Friday, or go to any Crate &amp; Barrel store for the repair disc.</Description>

            CPSC, L.L. Bean Inc. Announce Recall of Second Model of Backpack Child
            Carriers
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
            Commission (CPSC), L.L. Bean Inc., of Freeport, Maine, is recalling about
            13,000 backpack child carriers, model number W695. Small children can work
            their way out of the harness and fall through a leg opening or topple out of
            the top of the carrier, which can cause head and body injuries. On December
            10, 1998, L.L. Bean recalled another backpack child carrier, model number
            AC25, with a similar problem. 
            L.L. Bean has received 24* reports of children falling out of the harnesses of
            the model W695 carriers by slipping through a leg opening or toppling out of
            the top of the carrier. It was reported that three* of these children received
            injuries, including head bumps, a fractured wrist, bruises, abrasions and
            contusions. 
            The model number of these backpack carriers, W695, is written on a tag
            inside the rear storage compartment in the upper left side. They are teal and
            have gray harness straps. These backpack carriers have kickstands for loading
            the child into the carriers. The "L.L. Bean " label is on the back of the carrier. 
            The L.L. Bean website and catalogs, and L.L. Bean retail stores in Maine,
            Oregon, New Hampshire and Delaware sold the carriers between January 1993
            and March 1995 for about $95. 
            In December 1998, CPSC and L.L. Bean recalled 10,000 backpack child
            carriers, model number AC25. Small children can become entangled in the
            carrier's harness, which poses a strangulation risk. Also, like the second model
            carrier being recalled, small children can work their way out of the harness
            and fall through a leg opening or topple out of the top of the carrier, which
            can cause head and body injuries. 
            L.L. Bean received 23 reports of children falling out of the harnesses of the
            model AC25 carriers by slipping through a leg opening or toppling out of the
            top of the carrier. It was reported that 10 of these children received injuries,
            including head bumps, bruises, abrasions and contusions. Four of these
            children became entangled by the harness straps around their necks. 
            These forest green L.L. Bean Child Carriers have gray harness straps, and
            model number AC25, which is written on a tag inside the rear storage
            compartment. These backpack carriers have kickstands for loading the child
            into the carriers. The "L.L. Bean " label is on the back of the carrier. 
            The L.L. Bean website and catalogs, and L.L. Bean retail stores in Maine,
            Oregon, New Hampshire and Delaware sold these carriers between January
            1997 and October 1998 for about $99. 
            Consumers should stop using both of these carriers immediately and call
            L.L. Bean at (800) 555-9717 anytime or visit its website at
            www.llbean.com/recall to receive instructions for returning the carrier for a
            refund or for any other information about these recalls. *Updated 8/29/00</Description>

            CPSC, Peg Perego Announce Recall of Children's Riding Vehicles
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
            Commission (CPSC), Peg Perego USA Inc., of Fort Wayne, Ind., is recalling
            about 274,000 battery-powered children's riding vehicles for repair. Pedals can
            stick and electrical components can overheat, presenting fire and injury
            hazards to children. 
            CPSC and Peg Perego have received about 320 reports of electrical
            components overheating or pedals sticking. Thirty fires have been reported,
            resulting in one child suffering second-degree burns to his hand and at least
            $55,000 in property damage. One child suffered a concussion and six children
            received bruises when accelerator pedals stuck and the vehicles hit trees,
            fences, walls or parked automobiles. 
            The Peg Perego vehicles being recalled run on 12 volts, powered by two
            6-volt batteries, and were manufactured before December 1997. The vehicles
            are made of plastic and have been sold under the following model names:
            Corral 270, Diablo, Dragon, Gaucho, Gaucho Grande, Gaucho High Torque,
            Gaucho Sport, Magica, Magnum, Ranger GT, Thunderbolt, Thundercat, and
            Tornado. The model name and Peg Perego appear on each vehicle. The
            company will help consumers identify if their model is part of the recall. Peg
            Perego vehicles are intended for children 3 to 8 years old, and the vehicles'
            speed ranges from 2.5 to 5 mph, depending on the model.

            CPSC, Limited Too Inc. Announce Recall of Children's Fleece
            Robes
            WASHINGTON D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Limited Too Inc., of
            Columbus, Ohio, is voluntarily recalling approximately
            17,600 girls' fleece robes. The robes fail to meet federal
            flammability standards for children's-sized sleepwear. The
            standards require sleepwear, including robes, to be flame
            resistant, and if the garment ignites, the flame must
            self-extinguish. Failure to meet the flammability standards
            presents a risk of serious burn injuries to children. 
            Limited Too has not received any reports of injuries
            from these robes. This recall is being conducted to prevent
            the possibility of injury. 
            The robes involved in this recall are available in
            girl's sizes 7 through 14. The robes are 100 percent
            polyester fleece, and made in violet, teal and plaid. The
            front wrap robes have shawl collars and a tie belt. Some of
            the garments have matching satin trim around the front
            opening and collar. The robes are labeled "Limited Too" . .
            . "100% Polyester" . . . "Made in Sri Lanka." 
            Limited Too stores nationwide sold the robes from
            September 1998 through December 1998 for between $60 and
            $64. 
            Parents should immediately stop their children from
            wearing these robes. Return these robes to any Limited Too
            store for a refund of the full retail price or exchange. For
            more information about this recall, consumers should call
            Limited Too at (800) 934-4497 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30
            p.m. EDT Monday through Friday. Consumers also can write to
            the company at 3885 Morse Road, Columbus, OH 43219. 
            Robes in blue and ivory and robes above size 14 (junior
            sizes) are not subject to this recall. 
            In September 1998, CPSC and Limited Too announced a
            recall of about 390,000 children's satin pajama sets. These
            pajamas also failed to meet federal flammability standards
            for children's sleepwear. Limited Too has not received any
            reports of injuries from these pajamas. 
            These recalled pajamas are woven, 100 percent polyester
            pajama sets with a satin finish sold in sizes 6 through 14.
            They are two-piece pullover or front-button styles with
            sleeveless, short or long sleeved tops, available in a
            variety of colors and patterns. The sleepwear is labeled,
            "made in Hong Kong", "Macau", "China," or "Sri Lanka." 
            Limited Too stores nationwide sold these pajamas from
            December 1995 through July 1998 for about $15 to $39. 
            Parents should immediately stop their children from wearing
            these pajama sets and return them to a Limited Too store for
            a full refund or contact Limited Too at the above phone
            number or address.</Description>

            CPSC, L.L. Bean Inc. Announces Recall of Backpack Child
            Carriers
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), L.L. Bean Inc., of
            Freeport, Maine, is recalling about 10,000 backpack child
            carriers, model number AC25. Small children can become
            entangled in the carrier's harness,which poses a
            strangulation risk. Also, small children can work their way
            out of the harness and fall through a leg opening or topple 
            out of the top of the carrier, which can cause head and body
            injuries. 
            L.L. Bean has received 23 reports of children falling
            out of the harnesses by slipping through a leg opening or
            toppling out of the top of the carrier. It was reported that
            8* of these children received injuries, including head
            bumps, bruises, abrasions and contusions and four of these 
            children became entangled by the harness straps around their
            necks. 
            These forest green L.L. Bean Child Carriers have gray
            harnesses, and model number AC25, which is written on a tag
            in the upper left side of the rear storage compartment.
            These "backpack" carriers have kickstands for loading the
            child into the carriers. The "L.L. Bean " label is on the
            back of the carrier. 
            The L.L. Bean website and catalogs, and L.L. Bean
            retail stores in Maine, Oregon, New Hampshire and Delaware
            sold the carriers between January 1997 and October 1998 for
            about $99. 
            Consumers should stop using the carriers immediately
            and call L.L. Bean at (800) 555-9717 anytime to receive
            instructions for returning the carrier for a refund or for
            any other information about this recall. 
            Other models of L.L. Bean backpack child carriers are not part of this recall. *Updated 8/29/00</Description>

            CPSC, Rubie's Costume Co. Inc. Announce Recall of Children's
            Vampire Capes and Witch Brooms
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Rubie's Costume Co. Inc.,
            of Richmond Hill, N.Y., is recalling about 6,000
            children's vampire capes and about 6,000 children's witch
            brooms. The capes and the brooms, which fail to meet federal
            mandatory standards for flammability, could ignite readily
            and present a serious risk of burn injuries to children. 
            CPSC and Rubie's Costume Co. Inc. are not aware of any
            injuries involving these capes or brooms. This recall is
            being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. 
            The vampire capes are made of black vinyl. The edges of
            the cape are scalloped. The capes are packaged in a plastic
            sleeve with a cardboard insert, which reads in part,
            "Child's Vinyl Vampire Cape...No. 50282...Made in China."
            The Rubies logo and a picture of a boy wearing the cape are
            also on the insert. 
            The witch brooms are 27 inches long with a bamboo
            handle and brush made of twigs. The brooms were sold with a
            sticker around the handle, which reads in part,
            "Child's Authentic Witch Broom...Style No. 85." The Rubies
            logo is also on the sticker. 
            Toy, party, costume, discount and drug stores
            nationwide sold the capes and brooms for about $2 each from
            September 1997 to October 1998. 
            Consumers should not let their children wear the
            vampire capes or use the 27-inch witch brooms this
            Halloween. Consumers should return the products to the
            stores where purchased for a refund. For questions about
            this recall, consumers should call Rubies Costume Co. Inc.

            CPSC, Deckers Outdoor Corp. Announce Recall of Children's Teva Sandals
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
            Commission (CPSC), Deckers Outdoor Corp., of Goleta, Calif., is recalling
            about 65,000 children's Teva sandals. The straps attached to the footbed of the
            sandals can come apart. This can cause falls. 
            Deckers is aware of a 2-year-old who reportedly fell when one of the
            sandals he was wearing came apart, injuring his lip, gum and tooth. 
            These Teva sandals have straps that are "Abstract Bright," which are red,
            blue and yellow; "Abstract Pink," which are pink, purple, black and white; and
            "Frog Blue," which are blue, white and black. The footbed of the sandals are
            black. The bottom of the sole is marked with a star pattern along with the
            words "Teva" and "made in U.S.A." The shoes were packaged in a plastic box.

            CPSC, Limited Too Inc. Announce Recall of Children's Satin Sleepwear
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
            Commission (CPSC), Limited Too Inc., of Columbus, Ohio, is voluntarily
            recalling about 390,000 children's satin pajama sets. The pajamas fail to meet
            federal flammability standards for children's sleepwear. The standards require
            sleepwear to be flame resistant, and if the fabric ignites, the flame must
            self-extinguish. Failure to meet the flammability standards presents a risk of
            serious burn injuries to children. 
            Limited Too has not received any reports of injuries from these pajama
            sets. This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. 
            The satin pajama sets involved in this recall are available in sizes 6 through
            14. The pajamas are woven, 100 percent polyester with a satin finish. The
            garments are two-piece pullover or front-button styles with sleeveless, short or
            long sleeved tops and bottoms, available in a variety of colors and patterns.
            The sleepwear is labeled "made in Hong Kong," "Macau," "China" or "Sri
            Lanka." 
            Limited Too stores nationwide sold the pajamas from December 1995
            through July 1998 for about $15 to $39. 
            Parents should immediately stop their children from wearing these pajama
            sets and return them to a Limited Too store for a full refund. For more
            information about this recall, consumers should call Limited Too at 
            (800) 934-4497 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EDT Monday through Friday.
            Consumers also can write to the company at 3885 Morse Road, Columbus, OH
            43219. 
            This recall involves only 100 percent polyester, woven satin sleepwear sold
            from December 1995 through July 1998. All other sleepwear sold prior to
            these dates and sleepwear currently being offered by Limited Too is not
            subject to this recall.</Description>

            CPSC, Evenflo Co. Inc. Announce Recall to Repair Child Carriers
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
            Commission (CPSC), Evenflo Co. Inc., of Piqua, Ohio, is recalling about 22,000
            Hike 'N Roll child carriers for repair. Small children can slip sideways into the
            leg openings, creating a potential strangulation risk. 
            Evenflo has received 16 reports of children slipping into the leg openings,
            with some reports of red marks on the child's neck. No serious injuries have
            been reported. 
            Evenflo is offering a free seat insert to reduce the size of the leg openings
            and provide a more secure fit. 
            The Hike 'N Roll carriers being recalled are model numbers 522101 and
            522102. They were manufactured between June 1, 1996, and October 31, 1997.
            Both the model number and the manufacturing date are found on a white tag
            attached to the bottom of the carrier. These carriers are green and blue or blue
            and beige. They can be used both as a backpack carrier and as a stroller.
            "Evenflo" is printed on the front and back of the carrier. 
            Juvenile product stores nationwide sold these carriers from June 1996
            through June 1998 for about $65. 
            Consumers should stop using the carriers immediately and call Evenflo at
            (800) 649-0071 anytime to receive the free seat insert. Consumers can also view a video clip about this recall (Transcript). It is about 10 megabytes long and the download time depends upon the speed of your Internet connection.</Description>

            CPSC, MacKenzie-Childs Ltd. Announce Recall of Paper Candle Shades
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), MacKenzie-Childs Ltd., of
            Aurora, N.Y., is recalling about 42,000 paper candle shades.
            Use of the paper shade with a candle presents a fire hazard. 
            MacKenzie-Childs has received three reports of the paper
            shades igniting after contacting the flame of the
            accompanying candle. There is one report of minor property
            damage. No injuries have been reported. 
            The paper shades are decorated with various colors and
            designs, beads and ribbons. "MacKenzie-Childs, Ltd" is
            printed inside the shades. The shades measure about 5 inches
            high, 2 inches wide on top and 6 inches wide on bottom. The
            shades are designed to sit on top of a candle with the use
            of a metal candle follower. The top of the candle follower
            supports the shade, and the bottom sits on top of the candle
            and moves down the length of the candle as it melts. 
            Specialty gift and department stores nationwide sold
            the paper shades from January 1992 through April 1998 for
            about $38 to $95. 
            Consumers should immediately stop using the paper
            shades with candles. Consumers should return the original
            paper shade to the store where purchased to receive a free,
            replacement paper shade that is fire-resistant. For more
            information, consumers can call MacKenzie-Childs at (800)
            640-0488 between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. EDT Monday through
            Friday.</Description>

            CPSC, Payless ShoeSource Announce Recall of Children's Sneakers
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
            Commission (CPSC), Payless ShoeSource Inc., Topeka Kan., is recalling about 80,000
            children's sneakers sold at its shoe stores. The teddy bear or heart metal clasps on the

            Payless knows of two children ingesting the teddy bear metal clasps, and one of
            these children reportedly started to choke. 
            There are two types of sneakers involved in this recall. Both are COASTERS 
            brand, and both have white rubber soles, canvas uppers, and middle zippers. The
            "Royal Zipper Low" is royal blue with a metal teddy bear clasp attached to the zipper.
            The "White Zipper Low" is white and has a metal heart clasp attached to the zipper.
            The sneakers were available in sizes toddlers 5 through 10. "COASTERS " is written
            both inside and on the bottom of the shoes. 
            Payless ShoeSource stores nationwide sold these sneakers from March 1998
            through June 1998 for about $10. 
            Consumers should immediately take these sneakers away from children and return
            them to their local Payless ShoeSource store for a refund. Consumers also can mail the
            shoes to Payless ShoeSource Sneaker Recall, 3231 E Sixth St., Topeka, KS, 66601
            with their return address enclosed for a full refund and postage reimbursement. For

            identification number, "3659," and the words, "Made in
            China." 
            The purses were sold at Payless ShoeSource stores
            nationwide from Feb 1998 through May 1998 for about $8.

            CPSC, Toys "R" Us Announce Recall of Children's Soap Craft
            Set
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S.
            Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Toys "R" Us, of
            Paramus, N.J., is recalling about 4,000 Baskets of Bubbles
            children's craft sets because of a potential fire hazard. If
            consumers melt pieces of the soap disks that come with the
            set in a microwave oven for 10 minutes, as instructed, the
            soap could ignite in the microwave. The instructions should
            have read 10 seconds rather than 10 minutes. 
            Toys "R" Us has received two reports of the soap and
            its container melting together in a microwave and one report
            of flames inside the oven. No injuries have been reported. 
            Baskets of Bubbles is a craft set for children 12 years
            of age and older for making baskets of small, scented
            glycerin soaps in a variety of shapes, colors and sizes. The
            kit includes disks of colored, scented soap to cut into
            pieces to melt in a plastic measuring cup that comes with
            the set. Plastic molds to shape small bars of soap and two
            baskets to hold the finished soap are included. 
            Baskets of Bubbles sets are labeled "Arts &amp; Crafts by
            Alex...Baskets of Bubbles." The sets are identified as Toys
            "R" Us number SKN 668192, manufacturer number 70, UPC
            7-31346-00707-0. 
            Toys "R" Us stores nationwide sold the soap craft sets
            from November 1997 to December 1997 for about $15. 
            Consumers should immediately return the craft set to
            the nearest Toys "R" Us store for a full refund.</Description>

            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
            Safety Commission(CPSC), three firms are voluntarily recalling
            nearly 42,000 sets of children's toy jewelry. The
            necklaces and bracelets involved in this recall can break,
            releasing small beads that pose a choking and aspiration hazard
            to children under three years of age. 
            CPSC and the firms involved in the recall are not aware of
            any injuries involving the toy jewelry. This recall is being
            conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. 
            A. A. of America Inc. of East Brunswick, N.J., is recalling
            more than 5,300 sets of 12 bracelets packaged as party favors.
            The bracelets' beads are in various shapes, including disks,
            hearts and flowers, and are strung on elastic string. The label
            on the cardboard header reads in part "FUN TIME PARTY FAVORS,
            MADE IN CHINA." In a purple box on the left side of the cardboard
            header is an illustration of children sitting around a table for
            a party. 
            Almar Sales Co. Inc. of New York, N.Y., is recalling more
            than 8,600 matching children's necklace and bracelet sets with
            plastic beads strung on elastic string. The beads are in various
            shapes, including balls, hearts, smiley faces and teddy bears.
            The mostly white hang tag has outlines of different-colored
            flowers. "Expressions BY ALMAR" is written in pink on the tag,
            and "FUNWEAR JEWELRY" is written in blue. A set will bear one of
            the following item numbers: NB110, NB112, NB124, NB129 or NB137.

            about 28,000 matching toy necklace and bracelet sets. The three
            sets include pastel beads with hearts, multicolored beads
            and silver disks with bows, and beads with fish and cubes. All
            beads and shapes are strung on elastic string. The sets are held
            together by a cardboard wrapper that reads in part, "...
            MERMAID ... Kiddie Necklace Bracelet Set." Each set bears the
            item number NB2490, NB2491, NB2492 or NB2493. 
            All these toys were sold in children's, dollar-type and
            discount stores nationwide through March 5, 1997 for about $1.
            Consumers should take the toy jewelry sets away from young
            children immediately and return them to the store where purchased
            for a full refund. For more information about this recall,

            Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207
            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT:Ken Giles August 5, 1997 (301) 504-7052 Release #97-169 
            CPSC, Gymboree Corp. Announce Recall of Children's Umbrellas 
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Gymboree Corp. of
            Burlingame, Calif., is voluntarily recalling about 6,500
            children's umbrellas that have surface coating decorations
            with high levels of lead. This violates the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Act. In addition, about 700 similarly
            decorated beach and golf umbrellas are being recalled.
            Ingestion of high levels of lead can present a risk of lead
            poisoning to young children. Lead poisoning in children is
            associated with behavior problems, learning disabilities,
            hearing problems and growth retardation. 
            CPSC and Gymboree are not aware of any reports of
            illness involving these umbrellas. This recall is being
            conducted to prevent the possibility of illness. 
            The Gymboree umbrellas come in "kid-sized" compact,
            golf and beach varieties, and are multi-colored with
            polka-dot, stripe and checkered square panels alternating
            with solid color panels. The kid-sized compact umbrella has
            a clown on the purple panel. Model numbers do not appear on
            the umbrellas, but are on the price tag. The child's
            umbrella has model number 27000033, the golf umbrella has
            model number 27000025 and the beach umbrella has model
            number 27000041. 
            Gymboree stores sold the umbrellas nationwide from
            September 1996 through May 1997 for about $12 to $30,
            depending on the model. 
            Consumers should take these umbrellas away from
            children immediately and return them to any Gymboree store
            for a full refund. For more information about this recall,
            consumers should contact Gymboree at (800) 558-9885 between
            9 a.m. and 5 p.m. PDT Monday through Friday.</Description>

            CPSC, OddzOn Products Inc. Announce Recall of Children's
            "Starfish" Swimming Vests: Buckles Can Unlatch
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), OddzOn Products Inc. of
            Campbell, Calif., is recalling about 5,000 children's
            swimming vests manufactured in 1996 and sold under the brand
            name "Starfish." The vest's buckles can unlatch unexpectedly
            while in use, releasing a child into the water. Children
            could drown if they are released into the water without the
            aid of the swimming vest. 
            OddzOn Products Inc. has received one report of the
            buckles unlatching. No injuries have been reported.
            The "Starfish" inflatable plastic swimming vest has a
            blue inner lining and collar and a yellow and pink body
            secured by two plastic buckles in the front. The "Starfish"
            logo and name appear on the front of the vest and on the
            buckles. The vest is available in sizes A through D and is
            intended for children between 1 and 8 years old. 
            Toy, sporting goods, and gift stores nationwide sold
            the swimming vests from May 1996 through March 1997 for
            about $14. 
            Consumers should take the "Starfish" swimming vests
            away from children immediately and return them to the store
            where purchased for a full refund. For more information
            about this recall, consumers should call OddzOn Products at

            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Nychelle White Originally issued March 25, 1997, Revised April 4, 2003 (301) 504-7063 Release # 97-090 
            CPSC and Keysheen International Corp. Announce Recall of
            Children's Chaise Lounge Chairs
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Keysheen International
            Corp. of Taiwan is recalling about 38,300 children's folding
            chaise lounge chairs. If the support leg of the chair's
            footrest is not fully extended when a child sits down, a
            child's fingers can get trapped between the support leg and
            the metal frame, causing a pinching or amputation injury. 
            CPSC has received one report of a 4-year-old child's
            fingertip being amputated as the child sat down in the
            folding chaise lounge chair. 
            The frame of the lounge chair is made of 1/2-inch metal
            tubing of various colors. The chair has two white armrests
            measuring 12 inches long. The chair's metal frame is covered
            with brightly colored printed fabric of various designs.
            When fully extended, the chair measures 46 3/4 inches long
            by 13 1/2 inches wide, and the seat stands 6 inches above
            the floor. There is a sewn-in label on the back of the chair
            that reads in part, "SHEENTEX FABRIC...KEYSHEEN." The chair
            has a 65 pound weight limit, which makes it suitable for
            children about 8 years old and younger.
            Retail stores nationwide, including Linens 'n Things,
            Hecht's, Kohl's, Fred Meyer, Robinsons May, and Hills, sold
            the chairs from 1994 to 1997 for about $15 to $20. 
            Consumers should take the chairs away from children
            immediately. To receive a full refund, consumers should call Keysheen toll-free at (877) 539-7436 for instructions. Consumers
            should destroy the chairs to prevent further use by
            children.</Description>

            Recall
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Speidel of Providence,
            R.I., is recalling about 211,000 children's identification
            bracelets sold under the name My First ID. The bracelets
            present a choking hazard to children under age 3.
            The bracelets are marketed for children packaged in a
            cardboard gift box shaped like a wooden alphabet block
            labeled, "MY FIRST ID by Speidel." A label attached to the
            bracelet warning that the bracelet is not intended for
            children under age 3 is not visible at the point of
            sale. Some bracelets were additionally labeled,
            "...Specially sized for little ones...Perfect for
            commemorative first occasions like:...First
            Birthdays...First Words...First Steps..."
            CPSC and Speidel are not aware of any injuries
            involving these bracelets. This recall is being conducted to
            prevent the possibility of injury.
            The gold- or silver-tone metal bracelets, measuring 5
            to 5 1/2 inches long, can be engraved with identification or
            commemorative information. The bracelets came in the
            following eight styles (model numbers are found on a sticker
            on the box): Model 2350 is a metal chain of small,
            simulated pearls in linked, metal settings with a
            heart-shaped charm. 
            Models 2351 through 2354 are metal chains with a thin
            curved plate (measuring between 3/4 and 1 3/8 inches long by
            3/16 and 1/2 inch wide) for engraving, with a heart,
            cross, or bear charm attached.
            Models 2355, 2589, and 2590 are metal chains with a
            thin curved plate (measuring between 3/4 and 1 3/8 inches
            long by 3/16 and 1/2 inch wide) for engraving. Model 2355
            has a heart-shaped cut out on the plate.
            The bracelets sold at Wal-Mart, JCPenney, Hills, Cole
            Gift Centers, and Meijer stores along with other department,
            discount, and jewelry stores nationwide from June 1995
            through December 1996 for about $11 to $16.
            Consumers should immediately take these bracelets away
            from children under age 3, and return the bracelet to the
            store where purchased for a full refund. For more
            information, consumers can call Speidel toll-free at (800)

            Chair
            WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
            Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Now Products of Cicero,
            Ill., is announcing a recall to home repair approximately
            20,000 foam chairs for children. Children can unzip the
            chair's fabric cover, exposing a thin, clear plastic liner,
            which could cause choking. 
            Now Products is aware of two incidents of children who
            removed the plastic from the furniture and placed the
            plastic in their mouth. One child required medical
            treatment. 
            The foam chairs measure 11 inches high, 11 inches wide,
            and 15.5 inches deep. The chair's fabric cover features
            pictures of animals and children's drawings. A white label
            which reads in part, "NOW PRODUCTS INC." and a zipper are
            located on the bottom of the chair. 
            Ames Department stores sold the chairs with matching
            ottomans and sofas nationwide from January 1994 through June
            1996 for approximately $50. 
            Consumers should take the chairs away from children
            until the chairs have been repaired. For a free repair kit,
            consumers should call Now Products at (800) 535-3218,
            extension 33, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central time,
            Monday through Friday.</Description>

Consumers with young children who purchased the sewing board should stop using it immediately and return it to any FAO Schwarz for a full refund. For more information, consumers should contact FAO Schwarz at (800) 400-4326.FAO Schwarz is not aware of any injuries or complaints regarding the sewing boards</Description>

Because of an assembly defect in the light bulb socket, the lamp can short circuit, creating a fire or electric shock hazard.

A 28-year-old Pennsylvania man reportedly turned on the lamp and received a shock that blew out the house circuit breaker.The lamps measure 16 inches tall, come with a white and red striped shade, and have green, red, and yellow painted wooden bases. Hills sold them exclusively in 1993 and 1994 for under $15. The lamp cartons are marked as SKU #8000 for the dinosaur, and SKU #8001 for the frog, airplane, or rocking horse.Consumers who own one or more of these lamps should stop using them and return them to a Hills Department Store for a full refund</Description>

        <Description>December 1, 1994 Release # 95-039 WASHINGTON, D.C. - CPSC, HarperCollins Publishers, New York, N.Y., is voluntarily recalling about 46,500 copies of the children's book, "CHRISTMAS IN THE MANGER," by Nola Buck and Felicia Bond.The book, which is for small children, depicts the Christmas nativity story and incorporates textured surfaces on each picture page. The page showing the Three Wise Men is decorated with three, colored, plastic, artificial, jewels pasted to the page. The plastic jewels may separate during use and are small parts, which present a potentially serious risk of being aspirated into a small child's lungs.The publisher reported to CPSC when they learned of two instances where the artificial jewels became detached. Neither the firm nor CPSC is aware of any injuries involving the book. The recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury.The book measures approximately 6 inches by 6 1/2 inches and incorporates seven heavy paper pages plus the cover held together by a white, plastic, spiral binding. The front of the book bears the title, "CHRISTMAS IN THE MANGER," along with the names of the author and illustrator and shows the manger scene, while the back of the book reads, "HarperFestival A Division of HarperCollins Publishers *** Manufactured in China."The books were sold by Walden Books, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers nationwide from September to November 15, 1994, for about $9.95. The books should immediately be taken away from young children and returned to the store where purchased for a refund of the purchase price. For more information on this recall, call HarperCollins at (800) 538-8856, or the CPSC at (800) 638-CPSC. The firm may correct and continue to distribute their inventory of the same books by substituting paper for the plastic jewels.

        <Description>April 22, 1994 Release # 94-060 PRODUCT: Approximately 172,000 yellow hard plastic sound- making baseball bats made by the Processed Plastic Company. The words "Thunderbat" and "Tim Mee Toy" appear on the bat's plastic covering. When swung, the soundmaker inside the bat mimics the sound of a baseball being hit. The bats were sold with a white plastic ball and distributed nationwide from December 1992 through September 1993. Only bats with yellow end caps are involved in this recall. PROBLEM: The bat's yellow plastic end cap and noisemaker inside the end cap may detach from the bat during use and strike a bystander. The company has received 5 reports of end caps and noisemakers detaching from the bats while in use. WHAT TO DO: Check to make sure the yellow end of the bat is stapled securely to the bat. If the end of the bat is not secured, return the bat to the place of purchase or call Processed Plastic at (800)323-6165, x223 for a replacement or full refund. WASHINGTON, DC -- Processed Plastic Company, Montgomery, IL, in cooperation with CPSC, is voluntarily issuing a recall of its yellow tipped "Thunderbat" sound baseball bat, model numbers 39600, 39603, 39604, and 39606. The Company is asking that consumers check to make sure that the plastic end cap is stapled securely to the bat. If the end cap is not securely stapled, the end of the bat can separate from the bat and strike a bystander. This recall applies only to Thunderbats with yellow end caps. The Thunderbat baseball bat mimics the cracking sound of a bat hitting a baseball when swung properly. The bat is made of yellow hard plastic, a yellow tip, and sold with a white plastic ball. The sound is produced by a noisemaker (located in the bat) that strikes against an interior wood anvil plastic shield when swung properly. The interior shield is fitted with a stapled yellow end cap. The Company has received five reports of end caps and noisemakers detaching from the bats when the staples at the end of the bat tore loose. Separation of the end cap and noisemaker could result in the noisemaker becoming a projectile hazard and hitting a bystander. Approximately 172,000 Thunderbats were sold nationwide from December 1992 through September 1993. The bat and attached ball sold for approximately $5.00 each. Owners of all Thunderbats should check the bat to make sure the yellow end cap is fastened securely. If the end of the bat is not secured, consumers should return the product to the place of purchase or call Processed Plastic at (800)323-6265, x223 for a replacement or full refund</Description>

They have C-shaped headboard and footboard frames, partial guard rails on both sides of the upper bunk, and a middle leg on the side rail of the bottom bunk. Powell's other beds are not affected. PROBLEM: These "C" beds may unexpectedly collapse. Bed occupants could be injured by the falling upper bunk. CPSC is investigating the collapse of similar beds imported by others. WHAT TO DO: Stop using the bed or place both bunks on the floor immediately; inspect all eight mattress support corners; then call Powell at (310) 204-2224, weekdays between 11:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Eastern time for a free corner kit designed to reinforce the bed and prevent collapse. WASHINGTON, DC -- The L. Powell Company Inc., Culver City, CA, in cooperation with CPSC, is voluntarily providing a free corner kit to reinforce certain distinctive C-shaped children's tubular metal bunk beds imported and distributed by the company. According to Powell, the upper bunk on these beds could fall suddenly --usually after squeaking or creaking that consumers may not recognize as warning sounds -- causing the bunk bed to collapse. Powell's action responds to a CPSC bunk bed industry safety alert. The Powell Company has received 36 reports of "C" beds collapsing, including five reports of injury. Powell imported and distributed about 23,400 "C" beds to stores from June 1992 through March 31, 1993. A large percentage of the beds were sold by Pace Membership Warehouse, Inc. and Costco Wholesale. Powell is one of the largest distributors of children's tubular metal bunk beds. This action is being taken due to the firm's strong commitment to consumer safety. No other Powell beds are affected by this repair program. The bunk beds subject to this program -- models 440 (red), 446 (white), 447 (blue), and 448 (black) -- have metal frames made of hollow, glossy painted tubes, with a twin-size mattress on the top bunk and a larger, full-size mattress on the bottom bunk. In addition, the beds have the following identifying features: - the head and foot end frames are designed in a distinctive C shape; - a middle leg is attached to the center of the side rail of the bottom bunk; - there is a partial guard rail on each side of the upper bunk; - a gold "Warning" label is located on the top of the C-shaped end frame at the head or foot of the bed;the letters "FR" followed by a date code (month and year) are located on one of the two bed end frames or bunk side rails (only beds with date codes before April 1993 (4 93) are included in this program); and - Powell's address, "P.O. Box 1408, Culver City, CA 90232-1408," and the bed model number appear in the instructions and on the packaging. Any consumer who has one of these beds should immediately stop using it as a bunk bed. The bed can be used temporarily if both bunks are placed on the floor. The consumer should inspect all eight mattress support corners for breaks or cracks in the metal or paint around the welds and then call Powell at (310) 204-2224, weekdays between 11:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Eastern time. Any consumer who has a "C" bed made before April 1993 will receive a corner kit free of charge. The kit is designed to reinforce the bed and prevent collapse and has been tested by CPSC. CPSC is investigating numerous other importers and manufacturers of metal bunk beds that may present a similar risk of collapsing. To date, bed suppliers industry-wide have received more than 400 complaints of collapsing bunk beds. CPSC urges consumers to inspect all eight mattress support corners of all metal bunk beds for breaks or cracks in the paint or metal around the welds. Consumers should stop using damaged bunk beds and contact the retailer, manufacturer, or importer. To assist CPSC in its continuing industry-wide bunk bed investigation, consumers are urged to call the CPSC toll-free hotline weekdays at 1-800-638-2772 to report incidents or injuries involving metal bunk beds.

        <Description>February 17, 1994 Release # 94-038 PRODUCT: Approximately 4,435 bottles of Fem-Plus" nutritional supplements for women by Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. The recalled Fem-Plus were sold in white, opaque plastic bottles with blue screw-on plastic caps from 6/1/93 through 8/2/93. Each bottle contains 60 capsules with 25 milligrams (mg) of iron per capsule. PROBLEM: Because of its iron content, Fem-Plus must be sold in child-resistant packaging. The recalled bottles lack the required packaging. A child could easily open the bottle and ingest too much iron, leading to serious illness or death. WHAT TO DO: Return unused portions of any bottles to the place of purchase for a replacement or full refund. Consumers may call 1-800-783-2286. WASHINGTON, DC --- CPSC, Enzymatic Therapy, Inc., of Green Bay, WI is voluntarily recalling its "Fem-Plus" nutritional supplement for women. Because of its iron content, Fem-Plus must be sold in child-resistant packaging to comply with the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The recalled bottles lack child-resistant packaging. A child could accidentally ingest too much iron at one time, leading to serious illness or death. The recalled Fem-Plus were sold in white, opaque plastic bottles with blue screw-on plastic caps. Each bottle contains 60 capsules with 25 milligrams (mg) of iron per capsule. The bottle is labeled "HERBAL BIO-THERAPY *** Fem-Plus *** NO. 811 *** 60 CAPSULES." The label also reads, "MANUFACTURED EXCLUSIVELY FOR ENZYMATIC THERAPY, INC., GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN 54311." This recall only applies to Fem-Plus packaged in containers with blue conventional screw caps. It does not include Fem-Plus packaged with white child-resistant caps labeled "push down and turn" nor any other iron-containing products manufactured by Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. Approximately 4,435 bottles of the recalled iron product were sold to consumers through retail health food and nutrition stores nationwide between June 1, 1991 and August 2, 1993. Enzymatic Therapy has been selling Fem-Plus in child-resistant packaging since August 3, 1993. Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. has manufactured and sold this product for several years. Neither Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. nor the Commission is aware of any poisoning incidents due to the Fem-Plus iron capsules. However, the Commission is aware of several ingestions and at least 25 deaths since 1990 from other iron- containing products, as reported by the National Association of Poison Control Centers. Consumers should immediately return unused portions of any bottles of the recalled Fem-Plus capsules to the store where they purchased it. They will receive either a replacement bottle with child-resistant packaging or a full refund. Consumers may call Enzymatic Therapy's toll-free number 1-800-783-2286 for more information. CPSC became aware of the packaging problem through its ongoing poison prevention packaging inspection program. CPSC enforces the requirement that any dietary supplement containing an equivalent of 250 mg or more of iron per package must have child-resistant packaging. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is announcing this recall as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's mission is to reduce the estimated 28.6 million injuries and 21,700 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction</Description>

Testing by the company revealed that the levels of lead in the products' paint exceeds government standards, presenting a safety hazard to children.

Both the necklaces and bracelets are constructed of wooden blue, pink, purple, and yellow colored beads with white wooden rabbits and orange wooden carrots strung on elastic strings. Each product is packaged in an 3-inch by 3-inch cardboard box with a transparent plastic lid. The boxes are not labeled except for a small adhesive tag attached to an elastic string which says "Made in China" and bears the Cannon Falls copyright.

(SEI), Dallas, TX, is voluntarily providing reinforcement brackets for certain children's tubular metal frame bunkbeds. The upper level can fall unexpectedly causing the bunkbed to collapse. SEI has sold about 6,000 such beds since January 1990 in retail stores nationwide. The beds sold for approximately $150 to $300 each.

The bunkbeds subject to this program (models BB- 104-2, BB-105-2, BB-106-2, and BB-107-2) have metal frames made of hollow painted tubes. The glossy painted frame can be either red, blue, white or black. The beds use a standard twin-size mattress on the top bunk and either a twin or full-size mattress on the bottom bunk.

The two rectangular mattress support side rails are 3/4-inch wide and 1-1/2 inches high and a metal ladder attaches to the side of the bed as a separate unit.

To date, firms have received over 300 complaints of defective bunk beds industry-wide. CPSC urges all consumers to inspect all eight mattress support corners of all metal bunk beds for breaks or cracks in the paint or metal around the weld. Consumers should stop using damaged bunk beds and contact the retailer, manufacturer, or importer.

Some of the products were sold with sunglasses. All of the products sold are intended for young children. PROBLEM: These bags are being recalled because the surface coating on the zipper pull and inks used to form the insignia of Barney(R) and Baby Bop(TM) in some manufacturing lots were found to contain excess lead. Additionally, some of the accessory sunglasses do not meet shatter-proof lens tests, and the lenses could crack. WHAT TO DO: Discontinue use of all the items immediately and mail to: Jaclyn, Inc., c/o SPF, 415 Hamburg Turnpike, Wayne, NJ 07470. For assistance consumers may call 1-800-447-9279.

The firm is also recalling three styles of children's vinyl beach bags that do not feature Barney(R) or Baby Bop(TM); the beach bags have beach scenes with children or cats printed on them. Certain styles of Barney(R) bags, as well as the vinyl beach bags, were sold with sunglasses. The bags are being recalled because the surface coating on the zipper pull and inks used to form the insignia of Barney(R) and Baby Bop(TM) in some manufacturing lots were found to contain excess lead. Additionally, some of the accessory sunglasses do not meet shatter-proof lens tests, and the lenses could crack. Although only a portion of the Barney(R) and Baby Bop(TM) items made by Jaclyn are affected, the entire Barney(R) and Baby Bop(TM) product line is being recalled. The model numbers of the recalled Barney(R) and Baby Bop(TM) bags are: 4301 through 4309, 4350 through 4353, 3342, 3343 and 3370. Affected Barney(R) and Baby Bop(TM) bags include tote bags, shoulder bags and small handbags, as well as "fanny" packs and backpacks. The model numbers of the vinyl beach bags with children or cat scenes are: 3312, 3315 and 3371. Pictures of the recalled bags will be posted at all retail stores where they were sold. Both the vinyl beach bags and the Barney(R) and Baby Bop(TM) bags and backpacks were sold nationwide from October 1992 to March 1993. Retail prices ranged from $5.00 to $31.50 each. A total of approximately 650,000 bags were sold. Some of the retailers of the bags include Kay-Bee Toys, Kids-R-Us, Toys R-Us, Payless Shoe Source, Belk, Hills Department Stores, Sears, AandS, Bloomingdales, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Boscov's, Burdine's, Caldor, Carter Hawley Hale, Macy's and McCrory's. Jaclyn has asked all retailers to remove the recalled products from the shelves and return them to the company. Jaclyn voluntarily notified the CPSC and the FDA of the problems. While no incidents of illness or injuries have been reported, the company decided to recall the products promptly to prevent such a possibility. Consumers who have any of the recalled items should discontinue use immediately and return them to Jaclyn to receive a free preselected replacement item that meets or exceeds all Federal safety standards and looks identical or similar and is of equal or greater value. Consumers should return the recalled items by mailing them to: Jaclyn, c/o SPF, 415Hamburg Turnpike, Wayne, NJ 07470. For assistance in identifying the recalled products or with questions about the recall consumers may call 1-800-447-9279. The sunglasses that were sold with some of the bags, may be used separately. Consumers are urged to make sure to retrieve the glasses and return them along with the bags. EDITOR'S NOTE: Media inquiries should be directed to: Howard J.

        <Description>February 17, 1993Release #93-044 PRODUCT: Keds Flexibles infant's and young children's shoes with model numbers TH 2120, 2121, 2122, 2130, 2131, 2140 and 2141 followed by the designations TW-206 or CH-206, in sizes 2, 3, and 4 through 10. No other Flexibles shoes are affected by this recall. PROBLEM: The blue Keds label at the heel of the shoe may separate and could pose a choking hazard to young children. WHAT TO DO: Look at the upper right corner of the underside of the shoe tongue to see if the shoe is an affected model and has one of the designation numbers indicated. Return recalled shoes to the store where purchased for a replacement or full refund. Call 1-800-334-7447 toll-free with questions about this recall. WASHINGTON, D.C. -- CPSC, Keds Corporation of Cambridge, MA is voluntarily recalling certain Keds "Flexibles" shoes for infants and young children. The affected shoes, sizes 2, 3, and 4 through 10, include only models TH 2120, 2121, 2122, 2130, 2131, 2140, and 2141 followed by the designation TW-206 or CH-206. The Keds blue label, located at the heel of the shoe, can separate and be swallowed by an infant, possibly causing serious injury or death. There are no reports of injuries. The Keds Corporation urges all parents to return the shoes to the retailer where purchased for a replacement pair or a full refund. If the blue label can be easily removed from the heel, parents are urged to do so before the shoes are returned to the store. If the label cannot be removed easily, keep the shoes away from young children until the shoes can be returned. In addition to a refund, Keds will donate one dollar to K.I.D.S (Kids in Distressed Situations, Inc.) for each pair returned by consumers. The shoes come in three styles: JUMP (high lace), HOP (mid lace), and SKIP (mid velcro). The sole design features jumbled triangles, squares, and circles and comes in six different colors. Consumers can determine if they have purchased shoes affected by the recall by examining the upper right corner of the underside of the shoe tongue for the model number and designation. If an affected model number is followed by the designation TW-206 or CH-206, the shoes should be returned to the store. Shoes with a US-336 code are not affected by the recall. All other Keds Flexibles are manufactured with a different adhesion process and therefore pose no safety concern. Approximately 20,000 pairs of these shoes were sold nationally beginning in February 1992. The affected shoes have been removed from retail shelves. Customers may call 1-800-334-7447 toll free from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern Time if they have additional questions. The CPSC is announcing this recall as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of products under CPSC's jurisdiction</Description>

        <Description>JANUARY 13, 1993 Release # 93-031 PRODUCT: "Islander" children's sandals by Melville Corporation. The sandals have balloons fastened to the vamp of the sandals. PROBLEM: The balloons may come off, presenting a choking hazard to children. WHAT TO DO: Consumers should return the sandals to the place of purchase for a full refund. WASHINGTON, DC -- CPSC, Melville Corporation of Rye, NY, announces the voluntary recall of its "Islander" children's sandals. The sandals can be easily identified by the balloons that are fastened to the vamp of the sandals. The balloons on the sandals may come off. Because the sandals are intended for use by young children, the balloons, if detached, present a choking hazard. To date, the CPSC and Melville are aware of two incidents involving the sandals. Neither involved an injury. These shoes were sold throughout the United States in Kmart department stores and Pay Less Drugs stores between February and September of 1992. The sandals sold for $3.99 a pair. Consumers who purchased the sandals are asked to return them to the place of purchase for a refund. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is announcing this recall as part of it mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's mission is to reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under the CPSC's jurisdiction</Description>

        <Description>September 9, 1992 Release # 92-134 PRODUCT: Santa Fe Trading, Inc.'s 12-inch and 16-inch BMX sidewalk bicycles. PROBLEM: Both bicycles are equipped with only handbrakes; the 16-inch bicycle is also free-wheeling, which means the wheels operate independently of the pedal motion. Under Federal requirements, sidewalk bicycles may not be free-wheeling and may not have handbrakes only. WHAT TO DO: Consumers with these bicycles should contact the retail store where the bike was purchased and arrange for repairs which will bring the bikes into compliance. In lieu of repairs, consumers may also request a refund of the purchase price. WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Santa Fe Trading, Inc., Houston, TX is voluntarily recalling its 12- and 16- inch BMX sidewalk bicycles. Both bicycles are equipped only with hand-brakes and the 16-inch bicycle is also free-wheeling which means the wheels operate independently of the pedal motion. Under Federal requirements, sidewalk bicycles (bicycles with a seat height less than 25 inches in the highest adjustable position) may not be free-wheeling and may not have handbrakes only. Sidewalk bicycles that fail to meet these requirements present a significant risk of injury to a young child who might not be able to stop the bicycle with a handbrake. The sidewalk bicycles being recalled are: Name of the Product: 12-inch Sidewalk Bicycle Brand Name/Model #: BMX/901 Country of Origin: Taiwan Number of Units Sold: 146 Dates of Sale: May 27, 1992 - June 10, 1992 Distribution: Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana How Discovered: CPSC/Customs Surveillance Program at the Port of Houston Retail Price: Approximately $40.00 Name of the Product: 16-inch Sidewalk Bicycle Brand Name: BMX [no model number] Country of Origin: China Number of Units Sold: 172 Dates of Sale: April - June 1992 Distribution: Texas, Oklahoma How Discovered: Follow-Up CPSC Inspection Retail Price: Approximately $60.00 Consumers who have these bicycles should contact the retail store where the bicycle was purchased to arrange for repairs which will bring these bicycles into compliance. The handbrakes will also be removed from the 12-inch bicycle. The 16-inch bicycle will be retrofitted with a new seat post to raise the seat so that the bicycle will no longer be a "sidewalk" bicycle capable of being ridden by small children unable to use handbrakes. In lieu of these repairs, consumers may also request a refund of the purchase price. Neither CPSC nor the company is aware of any injuries involving these bicycles. This voluntary recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. Santa Fe Trading, Inc., is out of business, and therefore cannot be contacted about this recall. Consumers can only deal with the retail store where they bought the product.CPSC is announcing this recall as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction</Description>

        <Description>August 13, 1992 Release # 92-125 Over-The-Counter Antihistamine Recalled For Lack Of Child-Resistant Closure PRODUCT: "Valumed Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride," 25 milligram capsules in 100 capsule bottles manufacturered by Contract Pharmacal and soley distributed by Moore Medical Corporation. PROBLEM: 11,000 bottles of the product were distributed nationwide without required child-resistant closures. This medicine could cause serious health problems or death to a child who swallowed several of the capsules. WHAT TO DO: Immediately return the product to the store where purchased for a refund. WASHINGTON, DC - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Moore Medical Corp. of New Britain, CT is voluntarily recalling 100 capsule bottles of "Valumed" Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride (HCl) 25 milligram (mg) capsules manufactured by Contract Pharmacal of Hauppauge, NY. The drug is not packaged in child-resistant packaging as required under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA). The product is marketed as an antihistamine. This medicine could cause serious health problems or death to a child who accidentally swallowed several capsules. The recalled product contains 100 capsules with a total of 2500 mg of Diphenhydramine HCl per bottle. CPSC enforces the PPPA requirement that any over-the-counter medication containing more than the equivalent of 66 mg Diphenhydramine base in a single container must be supplied with child-resistant packaging. Moore Medical Corp. reported the packaging problem and initiation of this recall to CPSC. Consumers should immediately return the product to the store where purchased for a refund of the purchase price. Moore Medical Corp. distributed 11,000 of the bottles from November 1991 to mid-May 1992. They were distributed to 171 independent pharmacies, 214 chain drug stores, and 606 professional accounts (doctors, schools, nursing homes, etc.) nationwide, including Puerto Rico. Moore Medical Corp., the sole distributor of "Valumed" drug products, instituted the recall of this product, which was manufactured by Contract Pharmacal, because of its potential toxicity hazard to children due to the lack of child-resistant packaging. Neither the recalling firm nor the Commission is aware of any poisoning incidents due to the non-child-resistant packaging of this product. CPSC is announcing this recall as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction</Description>

        <Description>July 30, 1992 Release # 92-122 Three Children Killed By Decorator Cubes PRODUCT: Approximately 2.2 million decorator cubes with hinged lids. PROBLEM: In separate incidents, three children allegedly strangled when the cube's lid fell on their necks. The cubes also pose a suffocation hazard if a young child becomes trapped inside the cube with the lid closed because the cube does not have ventilation holes. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued two previous warnings regarding the decorator cubes and is again alerting the public because approximately 4,500 hinged lid cubes were distributed, inadvertently, by Seward Luggage Company during the recall program. Also, CPSC and Seward Luggage Company are attempting to increase consumer awareness about the potential hazards. These cubes may still be in hands of consumers or in the marketplace at liquidation centers and flea markets. WHAT TO DO: Consumers who have these cubes should call 1-800-766-9417 to obtain a free modification kit. Consumers who see the hinged lid cubes being sold should report the location to the Commission at 1-800-638-2772. BACKGROUND: The decorator cubes with hinged lids were the subject of a corrective action first announced by CPSC on March 27, 1991. The manufacturers of the cubes (Seward Luggage Company, Petersburg, VA; Trojan Luggage, Memphis, TN; and Mercury Luggage Manufacturing Company, Jacksonville, FL) are still attempting to notify consumers of the continued risk so the cubes can be modified. Decorator cubes manufactured after June 1990 have removable lids (no hinges) and are not subject to this warning</Description>

Recalls Children's Bicycles PRODUCT: Radio Flyer, Inc.'s #TR12 "Totally Rad Flyer Bicycle," and #LM13 "Little Miss Flyer Bicycle." Both bicycles are labeled "Radio Flyer" and are 12-inch girls' and boys' bicycles with training wheels. PROBLEM: Both bicycles are equipped with only handbrakes and no footbrakes. Under Federal requirements, these bicycles may not be freewheeling and if equipped with handbrakes, they must also have footbrakes. WHAT TO DO: Consumers with these bicycles should contact the retail store where the bike was purchased and arrange for modifications which will bring the bikes into compliance. In lieu of modifications, consumers may also request a refund of the purchase price. WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Radio Flyer, Inc. of Chicago, IL, is voluntarily recalling 137 12-inch girls' and boys' bicycles with training wheels. Both bicycles are equipped with handbrakes, but no footbrakes. Federal regulations require that these bicycles not be equipped with handbrakes only. CPSC believes that sidewalk bicycles with handbrakes, but without footbrakes may present a significant risk of injury to young children who might not be able to stop the bicycles with handbrakes. The models involved in this recall are #TR12 "Totally Rad Flyer Bicycle" and #LM13 "Little Miss Flyer Bicycle." Both are labeled "Radio Flyer." These bicycles were imported from Taiwan and sold nationwide during May 1992 in toy and retail stores, including Pay N Save Drug, Mills Fleet Farm, Bi-Mart Corporation, and Toys R Us. The bikes sold for approximately $50.00 each. The potentially hazardous bicycles were identified during a joint surveillance program conducted between CPSC and the U.S. Customs Service at the Port of Chicago. Consumers who have these bicycles should contact the retail store where they were purchased and arrange for modifications to bring these bicycles into compliance. In lieu of modifications, consumers may request a refund of the purchase price. Neither the CPSC nor the company is aware of any injuries involving this product. This voluntary recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. Consumers with questions about this recall may contact Radio Flyer, Inc. at 1-800-621-7613</Description>

        <Description>October 25, 1991 Release # 92-008 Power Wheels Porsche Battery-Powered Riding Automobile For Children Recalled WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Kransco Power Wheels of San Francisco, CA is voluntarily recalling the children's Power Wheels Porsche riding automobile which is powered by a rechargeable 18-volt battery. The automobile moves forward by pressing a foot pedal and stops when the pedal is released. A spring-loaded switch beneath the pedal is depressed to activate the motor. The recalled automobiles are equipped with a stronger, 18-volt battery system which, unlike the 12-volt battery used in previous models, may cause the switch's contact points to weld together during the initial surge of electricity. If this were to happen, the motor would remain running and the vehicle would continue moving forward, unable to stop. The CPSC was informed of this potential hazard by Kransco who discovered the problem when field testing the vehicle. The Power Wheels Porsche automobiles were distributed to retailers beginning August 21, 1991. On October 11, 1991, Kransco issued a voluntary recall to retailers of all 18-volt vehicles shipped as of that date. Approximately 12,000 vehicles were sold to retailers and the company estimates that about 1,000 units were sold to consumers. The vehicles sold for approximately $359-399 each. Owners of the affected units should stop use immediately. Consumers are asked to contact the company's customer service department at 1-800-348-0751 for instructions on how to disable the vehicle. Consumers will be sent a replacement switch which can be installed at home. Consumers are also given the option of returning the unit to one of the company's 260 nationwide service centers for the repair to be completed by an authorized service center employee. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission joins Kransco in announcing this repair program as part of its mission to insure that products purchased by American consumers are safe</Description>

        <Description>August 22, 1991Release # 91-114 Washington, D.C. - The Smith Cabinet Mfg. Co., Inc., Salem, IN, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), is voluntarily recalling 1,735 Childcraft cribs model nos. 15811, 15821, 15961 and 15991 if they have loose or missing side slats. These cribs were imported from Italy and sold nationwide from a limited number of retail stores after September 1988. The CPSC learned of this problem because of consumer complaints about loose or missing side slats received by its Chicago office. To date the company has received 22 such complaints. No injuries have been reported. Consumers are urged to check the bottom of the crib headboard for the model number. If they have one of the above models, they should check the side slats to make sure that they feel secure. If the side slats feel loose or are missing, the consumers may return the crib side rails to their place of purchase for a free replacement side rail. Loose or missing side rails may present an entrapment or escape hazard. For more information, consumers may call the manufacturer at (800) 725-8625 or write to the Smith Cabinet Mfg. Co., 501 E. Market Street, P.O. Box 444, Salem, IN 47167-0444. The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is the federal agency responsible for consumer product safety. Some 15,000 different types of consumer products fall within the Commission's jurisdiction</Description>

        <Description>May 16, 1991 Release # 91-067 Children's Laundry Hampers May Present Severe Laceration Hazard Washington, DC -- The "Dirty Dunk" and "Dirty Dunk, Jr." children's laundry hampers manufactured by Charlico, Inc., of Dallas, TX, may present a severe laceration hazard. Both of these products consist of a laundry basket attached to a backboard in the form of a basketball hoop and basket. The Dirty Dunk is mounted to an interior door with S-shaped hooks and a mounting bracket. The Dirty Dunk, Jr. is hung on an interior door with S-shaped hooks and plastic chain. The S-shaped hooks of either product could bend when partially loaded with clothes, and permit the unit to fall from the door and hit the user, typically a child. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) learned of the problem with the laundry hampers from a consumer complaint. The CPSC is aware of three incidents resulting from Dirty Dunks separating and falling from the S-shaped hooks. A five year-old boy suffered a fractured finger and a laceration requiring seven stitches. A three year-old boy suffered a partial amputation of a finger. An adult was struck on the back of the head while removing clothes from the hamper. Approximately 120,000 Dirty Dunks with defective S-shaped (white-colored) hooks were sold between June 1988 and March 1989. Approximately 20,000 Dirty Dunk, Jrs. with defective S-shaped (white-colored) hooks were sold between June 1989 and December 1989. Charlico discontinued the use of the white-colored hooks in March 1989, and thereafter, used stronger, orange-colored hooks. Because Charlico, Inc. has recently gone out of business, it is not recalling or repairing the product. Any consumer who has a Dirty Dunk or a Dirty Dunk, Jr. with white-colored S-shaped hooks should immediately stop using the product and (1) either destroy and discard the unit, or (2) replace the white S-shaped hooks with substantially stronger S-shaped hooks. This kind of product is generally available at hardware stores. The CPSC is the Federal agency responsible for product safety, and is issuing this warning as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. Some 15,000 kinds of products fall within the Commission's jurisdiction and each year these products are involved in an estimated 29 million injuries and 22,000 deaths</Description>

        <Description>CONTACT: August 16, 1990 (301) 504-7908 Release # 90-141 Child Electrocuted Floor Lamps Recalled WASHINGTON, DC -- The Coaster Company of America, headquartered in Sante Fe Springs, CA, is voluntarily recalling some 1,900 brass floor lamps because of a possible electrocution hazard. This hazard may be present even though the lamp switch is in the "off" position. Brass floor lamp models 2607, 2618 and 2620 sold nationwide since January 1987 are being recalled. They sold for about $50 each. All lamps feature three metal support legs bolted to a metal central post by metal screws or bolts. - Model 2607 features a single light socket atop the center post and three planter supports at the ends of the U- shaped support legs. - Model 2618 features a triple light socket and planter supports at the ends of the support legs. - Model 2620 features a glass tea table which rests atop three C-shaped metal support legs bolted to the central post. The company said certain screws holding the legs to the lamp's center post may be too long and could pierce the power cord insulation, energizing the entire brass frame. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has learned that one child was electrocuted in Alaska. Consumers with any of the lamps should immediately unplug them from electrical outlets and return the product to the store where purchased for a full refund of the purchase price. Consumers may also call Coaster Company of America at 1-800-221-9699 for additional information about the recall; California residents should call 213-944-7899</Description>

        <Description>Child Enclosures Recalled by Several Companies NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 28, 1988 Release # 88-117 New Infant Strangulation Prompts Second Recall Of Child Enclosures WASHINGTON--Another infant strangulation in Pennsylvania involving an expandable wooden enclosure has prompted the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue a second recall notice for old accordion style enclosures which have been involved in at least seventeen incidents resulting in four deaths. Noting that many thousands of the enclosures have not been returned to manufacturers and are still being used, CPSC said, consumers should immediately remove, collapse and store enclosures pending return of the product. First announced in May, 1986 as part of a consent agreement between CPSC and six manufacturers, the recalled enclosures were manufactured by Memline Corporation (under the name-Nu-Line Industries); WBI, Inc., (formerly Worldsbest Industries, Inc.); Paris Manufacturing Corporation; North States Industries; Mapes Industries, Inc.; and Creative Playthings (enclosures were last sold by the firm in 1974 and is not affiliated with Creative Playthings, Ltd., of Framingham, Massachusetts). CPSC said toddlers between 10 and 24 months of age are at the greatest risk because they can climb on the enclosure, and may slip and catch their the top of the enclosure. ead or neck in the V-shaped openings at They may also attempt to crawl through and become entrapped in the diamond-shaped openings in the middle of the enclosure. The angles of the V-shaped openings are narrow enough to entrap the head or neck of a child. For instructions on returning the enclosures, consumers should call Nu-Line Industries toll-free at 1-800-558-7300; Nu-Line is coordinating the recall for all manufacturers. As an incentive to return the enclosure, consumers will receive a $10 cash refund or a $15 coupon which may be used toward the purchase of any product manufactured by Nu-Line industries, Paris Manufacturing Corporation, or Northstates Industries, Inc.</Description>

The company is aware of one incident in which a child allegedly suffocated as a result of being caught between the netting and a metal leg. Care should be taken to ensure that this product is being properly used. Consumers should contact Gerber Furniture Group to receive warning labels for the Crawl Space and instruction sheet showing proper assembly.

The chairs were imported from Italy until 1985 and were distributed, primarily through national chain stores, from late 1982 through early 1986. The chair is a child-sized folding lawn chair with an aluminum - square tubular frame, white plastic armrests, and a fabric seat and back with a rainbow-striped design or a clown design on red or blue back- ground. Embossed on the top of both white plastic armrests are the words "Lerolin Thiene (1) made in Italy." The distributor estimates that in excess of 64,000 of the chairs are still in use. Twenty-two incidents have been reported in which children's fingers became caught when the chair was collapsed. In some cases severe laceration or loss of fingertip was reported. Consumers are urged to remove the chair from use immediately. To obtain a $5.00 refund for the product, consumers should cut the entire fabric seat and back from the chair and mail them both, along with their name, address and telephone number, to Action Industries, P.O. Box 116, Cheswick, Pa 15024. Refunds will be made only for chairs which match the description above. Owners are also advised to dispose of the chair frame after the fabric seat has been removed.

Decorative yellow plastic buttons shaped like 5 point stars are attached to the front of the shirt. When the Consumer Product Safety Commission subjected the stars to use and abuse testing, the stars, which are small parts, separated from the shirt. Neither the CPSC, nor the N.Y.A.G., nor Elkay Industries, Inc., knows of any injuries involving these garments. The stars are on a long sleeved knitted white shirt with red and blue stripes and the works "Little Pro" across the front in 1 l/4 inch letters. The shirt is sold with long corduroy pants. The label in the neck of the shirt says, "MADE IN U.S.A. KIDSTUFF*** RN 43051, AN APPAREL PRODUCT OF ELKAY". Approximately 9,200 units were sold nationwide from June 1986 to the present. Consumers who purchased these garments for children under three should immediately remove the stars from the shirt and discard them to eliminate potential choking hazards. Retailers who have "Little Pro" garments in stock should stop selling them immediately. Anyone wishing additional information may contact Elkay Industries Inc., on a toll-free number 800-223-2393 (calls made only from outside New York State) or a toll call number 212-560-7600 or contact the CPSC toll-free humber at 800-638-CPSC.

        <Description>July 31, 1986 Release # 86-047 Puck Children's Furniture Repairs Omar Crib Entrapment Hazards Washington D.C. -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Puck Children's Furniture, Inc., Miami, Florida, is voluntarily repairing its Omar Crib to eliminate a head and neck entrap- ment hazard which could result in suffocation, and a foot entrapment hazard. The top edge of the end panels of the Omar crib is an inverted "U" shape and these panels are adjustable in height. With either of the end panels in its lowest position, a V shaped opening between the end panel and-corner post creates an opening where a child's head and neck could be caught. In addition, when the mattress support is in its lowest position and the side rail is in its highest position, the bottom of the side rail is higher than the mattress support, creating a gap where a child's foot could be caught. Since October, 1983 a total of 1,137 Omar Model cribs have been distributed nationwide by Puck Children's Furniture. The crib retails for approximately $400. Neither the CPSC nor Puck Children's Furniture is aware of any reports of injuries involving this crib. The crib is available in both natural and white. Side rails and end panels are adjustable in height. The top of the slatted end panels is an inverted "U" shape, and there is a storage drawer under the mattres: support of the crib. Wheels are included with the crib. The crib is packaged in a carton labeled "Made in Italy - Puck Children's Furniture - Omar". The crib itself bears no labeling. Puck Children's Furniture has advised retailers to stop selling the Omar Cribs until they have been repaired. The repair kit includes a replacement stabilizer, wooden plugs and instructions for making the repairs. Consumers who purchased the Omar crib should immediately contact either the retail store where the crib was purchesed or Puck Children's Furniture at 305-634-2828 to obtain a free repair kit to correct these hazards. Consumers may also write to Puck Children's Furniture at 3620 NW 59th Street, Miami, Florida 33142 for the repair kit. Until the crib is repaired, consumers are advised to discontinue use or use only with the end panels in their highest position and the mattress support and side rails adjusted so there is no gap at the bottoms of the side rails. Puck Children's Furniture Repairs Omar Crib Entrapment Hazards Under laws administered by CPSC, an estimated 325 million potentially hazardous products have been called back from the marketplace and consumers since 1937 (when CPSC was created). Most of these were voluntarily recalled by manufacturers who established programs to repair or replace the products, or to refund the purchase price.

            Office of Information and Public Affairs
            Washington, DC 20207
            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
            May 15, 1986 
            Release # 86-30
            Children's Expandable Enclosures Recalled
            Washington, D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
            today announced that it has accepted a Consent Agreement from the 
            staff and six manufacturers of expandable wooden enclosures for infants
            and toddlers. In accepting the settlement, the Commission and the
            six manufacturers also announced a recall program for the enclosures.
            These enclosures are associated with three deaths, one incident of
            severe brain damage, and at least eleven incidents involving minor or
            no injuries.
            The manufacturers of the enclosures are Memline Corporation
            (under the name of Nu-Line Industries); WBI, Inc. (formerly .
            Worldsbest Industries, Inc.); Paris Manufacturing Corporation;
            North States Industries, Inc.; Mapes Industries, Inc.: and
            Creative Playthings (Creative Playthings last sold these products
            in 1974). These firms are participating in an extensive public
            notice and recall program to warn the public of the potential for
            head/neck entrapment-strangulation hazards presented by the
            enclosures, and to remove them from the possession of consumers.
            The enclosures are constructed of criss-cross wooden slats,
            riveted together, which expand to form closed circular structures of
            varying diameters. The Commission estimates that there are
            approximately 252,000 enclosures presently in the possession of
            consumers.
            Children between the ages of ten and twenty-four months can climb
            upon the enclosures, and may slip, and catch their heads/necks in the
            vee-shaped openings at the top of the enclosures, or attempt to crawl
            through and become entrapped in the diamond-shaped openings in the
            middle of the enclosures. (See drawing attached) The angles of the
            vee-shaped openings are sufficiently narrow so as to entrap the head/
            neck of a child, resulting in potential death by strangulation
            or in other serious injury.
            Consumers should immediately stop using the enclosures and
            return them to Nu-Line Industries, which is handling the recall
            for all the manufacturers. In return, consumers will receive a
            $10.00 cash refund or a $15.00 coupon which may be used toward the
            purchase of any product made by the following firms: Nu-Line
            Industries: Paris Manfacturing Corporation; and Northstates
            Industries, Inc. Consumers should call Nu-Line Industries, toll
            free, at l-800-558-7300, in Wisconsin call 414-842-2141 collect to 
            arrange for free pick up of the enclosures.</Description>

        <Description>Children's Jogging Suits Recalled by C.K. Enterprises NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 18, 1985 Release # 85-068 C.K. Enterprises Recalls Children's Jogging Suits WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and C.K. Enterprises, Richmond, California, today announced a voluntary recall of children's jogging suits sold by the firm. Approximately 6,200 units were imported from Hong Kong and sold nationwide. The jogging suits are identified as style 4061 and the firm has agreed to provide a full refund to consumers who return the jogging suits to the retail stores where they were purchased. Although these jogging suits have not been involved in any incidents known to the Commission or to C.K. Enterprises, testing shows that the jogging suits fail to meet the Commission's flammability requirement for general wearing apparel. The recalled children's jogging suits are two-pieced with a zip front jacket. The garments are made of 100% cotton fleece with a neck label tag "le top RN55104". The jogging suits were sold for $10.00 to $20.00 from July 1984 to March 1985. For further information consumers may contact C.K. Enterprises in writing: 4903 Central Ave., Richmond, CA or the Commission's Toll Free Hotline at 800-638-CPSC. A teletypewriter number for the hearing impaired is (301) 595-7054.</Description>

        <Description>Children's Expandable Enclosures Recalled NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 1, 1984 Release # 84-050 CPSC Issues Complaints On Children's Expandable Enclosures Washington, D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today announced that its staff has issued a Complaint against 6 manufacturers seeking the recall of children's expandable enclosures, sometimes called "baby corrals." These enclosures serve a purpose similar to a playpen. The Complaint alleges that these enclosures present a neck entrapment-strangulation hazard to children between the ages of 10 and 24 months. The Complaint further alleges that 3 deaths, 1 incident of severe brain damage, and 6 incidents involving minor or no injury are associated with the enclosures. The enclosures are constructed of criss-cross wooden slats riveted together which expand to form continuous circular structures of varying diameters. When the enclosures are opened for use, the slats cross one another in such a manner as to form series of vee- shaped openings around the entire circumference of the tops and bottoms of the enclosures, and closed diamond-shaped openings around the entire circumference of the middles of the enclosures. It is also alleged in the Complaint that children between the ages of 10 and 24 months can climb upon the enclosures, slip and catch their necks in the vee-shaped openings at the top of the enclosures, or attempt to crawl through and become entrapped in the diamond-shaped openings in the middle of the enclosures. The angles of the vee-shaped openings are sufficiently acute so as to entrap the neck and head, resulting in death by strangulation or in other serious injury, especially where the children's feet are not in contact with the ground. In addition to recall of the enclosures, the staff seeks an extensive notice campaign to warn the public of the neck entrapment strangulation hazard presented by the enclosures. The manufacturers named in the Complaint are: Memline Corporation, Suring, Wisconsin; Worldsbest Industries, Inc., Cudahy, Wisconsin; Paris Manufacturing Corporation, South Paris, Maine; North States Industries, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota; Mapes Industries Incorporated, Great Neck, New York: and CBS Incorporated, New York, New York. Anyone who knows of a death, injury, or other incident in which a child's head or neck became entrapped in a children's expandable enclosure is asked to call the CPSC toll-free Hotline at 800-638-CPSC. A teletypewriter number for the hearing-impaired is (301) 595-7054.</Description>

        <Description>Children's Cloth Books Recalled by Random House NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 4, 1984 Release # 84-001 Children's Cloth Books Recalled Because Of Small Parts Hazard WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Random House, New York, NY, today announced the voluntary recall of cloth books called My Button Book and Hello Kitty's Button Book because there is a risk that the buttons can be pulled off and are small enough to be a choking hazard to children under three. Approximately 72,000 of these books have been distributed nationwide since 1981. The books sell for approximately $3.50 each. CPSC is not aware of any injuries involving these books nor has Random House received any complaints. The My Button Book is made of fabric, and the front looks like a yellow sweater or shirt with a duck design is green, blue, red and white. There is blue trim around the neck, the center front and the bottom and three white plastic buttons and button holes down the center front opening. Inside the book there are five pages depicting children buttoning various types of clothing. The Ply Button Books are packaged in clear plastic bags with bright yellow cardboard headers which are labeled in part "A DO-IT cloth book . . , I CAN DRESS MYSELF, CAN YOU? . . Random House". Hello Kitty's Button Book is made of fabric and looks like a pair of blue coveralls with four white paws showing. There is a yellow button at each shoulder of the coverall. The coveralls are buttoned around a cardboard Hello Kitty figure with a white kitten face and red bow on the left ear. There are pictures inside showing Kitty buttoning various garments. There is a label over Hello Kitty's head which reads in part, "A DO-IT cloth book . . . Random House". Consumers should remove these books from use immediately and return them to the retailer where purchased for a full refund. Retailers should remove the books from sale immediately and return them to the Random House for refund. For further information, consumers may call CPSC's toll-free Hotline at 800-638-CPSC. A teletypewriter number for the hearing impaired is (301) 595-7054.</Description>

(March 10)-- A program to correct more than 100,000 outdoor "Fun Fountain" water toys which may cause serious injuries to children is being conducted by the Wham-O Mfg. Co. of San Gabriel, California. The firm, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, voluntarily will supply free corrective water flow control valve inserts for its "Fun Fountain" toys produced from 1977 through November, 1979. The toy consists of a clown hat and head which attaches onto the end of a garden hose so that the hat rises in the air when water flows through the clown's head. Children may be inclined to peer into the water outlet and the stream of water could cause serious eye injuries, especially in communities with high water pressure. CPSC so far has been informed of two consumer complaints since June, 1979, involving a six-year-old boy and a seven-year- old boy who suffered eye injuries when struck at close distance by water emitted from the "Fun Fountain" toys. The Wham-O "Fun Fountain" water toys were sold nationwide in toy stores and variety stores for approximately $10.00 each. The model number of the toy, #237, is imprinted on the toy's package. According to the company, the potential hazard has been corrected on all "Fun Fountain" toys manufactured since December, 1979 when the toys began to be produced with a water flow control valve to decrease and control the water flow. Such new editions are readily identifiable since they are equipped with a blue hose connector (the older design has a red connector) at the base of the clown head. The words "Important Notice" and "Safety Check List" also are imprinted on the new toy cartons. If the hose connector is red but contains a blue insert which is clearly visible, then it also has been corrected and is equipped with a water flow control valve. To correct the potential hazard in "Fun Fountain" toys manufactured before December, 1979, parents are urged to go to the place of purchase to receive a free water flow control valve insert, or they may contact Wham-O directly to receive a free valve insert (Customer Service Dept. 7, 835 East El Monte Street, San Gabriel, California, 91778). Consumers also may telephone Wham-O toll-free at 800/423-4174 (in California, call collect at 213/287-9681). The water flow control valve snaps easily into the hose connector and once installed will remain firmly within the connector, according to the company.</Description>

        <Description>Bicycle Child Carriers Recalled by Hamill &amp; Hufman NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 15, 1976 Release # 76-070 CPSC, Hamill Manufacturing Co., And Huffman Manufacturing Co., Announce Recall Of Bicycle Child Carriers WASHINGTON, D.C. (Oct. 15) -- Hamill Manufacturing Company, Washington, Michigan, and the Huffman Manufacturing Company, Dayton, Ohio, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, today warned consumers that 25,000 bicycle child carriers may separate from the bicycle if not carefully installed. The carriers were sold nationally under the trade name "Tote Along" during the summer of 1976. Persons who have these carriers should carefully inspect both the latching mechanism which locks the detachable child seat to the carrier and the metal clamp which attaches the front of the carrier to the bicycle frame. Before placing a child in the carrier, check to see that the seat and clamp are secure. The warning was issued after the companies reported to CPSC 10 accidents which involved either a separation of the seat from the carrier or of the carrier from the bicycle. Separation of the seat from the carrier appears to have been caused by a failure to push the seat onto the carrier far enough to secure the locking mechanism. Separation of the carrier from the bicycle may have been caused by consumer misalignment of the metal clamp components and/or extreme over-tightening of the bolt passing through the clamp. In the interest of child safety, the companies are recalling the "Tote Along" carrier and are offering a refund to consumers who send them the seat clamp. For instructions on how to receive a refund, consumers should write The Hamill Manufacturing Company, Consumer Relations Department, P.O. Box 255, Washington, Michigan 48094, or call Hamill collect at the following number: 216/379-7792.</Description>

        <Description>Greensboro Stops Sale Children's Sleepwear NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 22, 1976 Release # 76-027 CPSC Accepts Provisional Consent Agreement With Greensboro, N.C., Textile Firm WASHINGTON, D.C. (April 22) -- The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today announced it has accepted a provisional consent agreement that prohibits Greensboro Manufacturing Company from marketing children's sleepwear that fails to meet the standards of the Flammable Fabrics Act. Greensboro Manufacturing Company of 1900 E. Bessemer Street, Greensboro, North Carolina, is a subsidiary of GENESCO, Inc., of Nashville, Tennessee. According to the consent agreement the North Carolina manufacturer shipped to one of its customers children's sleepwear items that had flammability labels attached in inconspicuous places. Greensboro recalled the garments involved, style 1915, and the returned garments were replaced or credit given to the retailer. The sleepwear items were girls' gowns, size 0-6X, manufactured between July 29, 1972, and July 28, 1973, and retailed for about $2 each. At the time the enforcement proceeding began, a standard (DOC FF 3-71) under the Flammable Fabrics Act established a desired level of flame resistance and items that did not meet the goal required cautionary labels readily visible to warn consumers that products may be flammable. A consent agreement does not constitute an admission that the company has violated a law, but it provides for a settlement. Any violation of the consent agreement by the Company or its controlling officer could result in the assessment of substantial civil penalties. The complaint and consent order will be available for review for 60 days through June 21, 1976, during which time any interested person may submit comments to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. 20207. After considering any comments, the Commission may accept the agreement or withdraw its provisional acceptance. For additional information about the order, contact the Bureau of Compliance, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. 20207.</Description>

        <Description>S. Schwab To Halt Sale Of Children's Pajamas NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 5, 1975 Release # 75-021 Company To Halt Sale Of Children's Pajamas That Fail To Meet Flammability Test WASHINGTON, D.C. (March 5) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today informed consumers that a small number of boys' and girls' pajamas made by S. Schwab Company, Inc., Upper Potomac Industrial Park, Cumberland, Maryland, failed to pass the flammability test for children's flame retarded sleepwear sizes 0 to 6X. The pajamas were sold under the Schwab brand name, style "1170, Lot 953." Forty-two-and-a-half dozen pajamas were involved. The pajamas were 50 percent nylon and 50 percent polyester and came in two colors: pink with white dots and white lace trim and turquoise with white dots and white lace trim. The sleepwear sold in sizes small, medium and large, designated 1, 2, and 3, individually boxed, with each box bearing this label: "Flame Retardant Complies with Federal Stan'd. DOC FF 3-71." The sleepwear was sold during the summer of 1973 primarily to small retail shops in the Eastern United States. The Commission has provisionally accepted a consent agreement signed by S. Schwab Company. As part of the agreement, the Company has agreed to notify their retail purchasers and to conduct a recall of the non-complying garments. Richard D. Schwab and Leonard C. Schwab, the firm's principal officers, also signed the agreement. Consumers who bought this sleepwear should return it to the store where it was purchased or to the manufacturer. A consent agreement is a legal document in which the company involved usually agrees to stop manufacturing or selling non-complying goods, notify known purchasers and initiate a recall. The action on the part of the company is voluntary, and the company does not admit guilt in agreeing to the terms. The company also agrees not to violate flammability standards in the future. A violation of a consent agreement could result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation. The complaint and consent order will remain on the public record through May 5, 1975, during which time any interested person may submit comments to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, 1750 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20207.
